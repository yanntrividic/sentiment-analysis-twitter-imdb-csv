2021-04-03,tjdodson-72137,"I must say even though it was *slightly* dramatic in the beginning, I could still watch it. I accepted all the drama and decided to enjoy it. However, the second half just gets more and more dramatic as it goes on. Seriously though. I was laughing and groaning so much my face still kinda hurts. Like how many times can they almost die? And then when people finally do start to die everyone else is surprised! The drama was so *cough cough* intense I almost threw up some sea water. Welp if you like a lot of reality tv this is basically the same thing, just with a plot. I guess the acting was alright though. Enjoy!"
2021-04-01,OttersFilms,"I saw the film after its successful Oscars haul and found it a major let down. It seems that the more effort that film makers put into special effects, the less attention they give to the script.

I wanted to like this film but found it impossible to do so when, for me, the dialogue was dull, cliched and obvious; the special effects, although good, were not great and the central romantic relationship was unconvincing.

I did admire the costumes and sets, but overall it wasted an opportunity to create a memorable work of art and pay tribute to the fallen victims. The old Kenneth More film (A Night to Remember) is much better and was perhaps designed for an adult and not a teenaged audience."
2021-03-31,mazno-57733,This film is the best motion picture in my opinion.
2021-03-21,sabinamihailescu,"This movie it's incredible! For its year (1997) is well shot and edited. I love how they transform a tragedy in a love story but still emotional in a non-romantic way.""TITANIC"" is a movie that everyone should watch! It is not perfect, there are some small details that do not add up. But, in the end, ""TITANIC"" is the ship and movie of dreams!"
2021-03-20,sashareviewsthings,"I never cry at movies.

2021-03-19,asifuzzamanabirasmr,"Not a single thing on thia movie is bad. I repeat not a single thing. I think it's even pointless to give a review about it because every human being loves it. This is even famous and loved to those countries, those people who isn't familiar with English Movies!"
2021-03-11,giuseppinamaione,"After having seen this movie a million times, I decided to comment on it because it is spectacular. It is a true story, that luxurious ship hit an iceberg and it ended many lives of both adults and children. moving because in the intertwining of the facts it tells of a love story between Jack and Rose. One cannot fail to congratulate the protagonist Jack played by Leonardo di Caprio who in addition to his beauty is very talented. And nothing every time this film is aired, even if it is long, I'm always ready to see it again because it is truly a masterpiece."
2021-03-11,sandracirillo-88432,"I want to be honest saying that Titanic is my favorite movie, the actors act really well and the story, although the end is sad, is wonderful. I like the script of the characters and the social classes of which the protagonists are part, these filn shows that love is stronger than all people's prejudices. I recommend everyone to see it because you will be very satisfied."
2021-03-10,Front-Row-Reviews,"The stage curtains open ...

Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.

We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.

What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.

I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again."
2021-03-09,tanakom-00956,"Titanic is popular and legendary one of masterpiece movie, this about romantic love between Jack and Rose and this movie is base from true story that RMS Titanic crash to iceberg and the ships was fall down and drown to under the ocean and in a moment some of passenger was dead by drown and cold like freeze. James Cameron who direct this movie pick this tragedy event and add some romantic love and it's become to legend movie and many people still good remember. -The Technical of this movie: The CG, Soundtrack, and Cinematography is look amazing and good one, Although the time was pass for a long time but this CG still look amazing. This movie use many technique to help this movie complete with a prop like some part of ships and CG like ocean and iceberg but the thing that's make this movie popular and we can't disagree that is soundtrack ""My heart will go on"" -The character: For Jack Dawson starring by Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose DeWitt Bukater starring by Kate Winslet acting beautiful performance, where both actors were wonderfully suited to their role. It's like Leo and Kate become the Iconic of this movie of all time. -Overview: This movie has drama, action, romance all rolled into one, it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. An emotionally so powerful it's put you like you are the one in the passenger, the movie was a little long has so much detail, but it was true masterpiece and worth. You need to watch it!"

2021-03-03,zeekvoarik,"I first saw this movie in theatres. When it came out, I was skeptical. I am not a overly-enthusiastic about the majority of historical movies but, I decided to give this one a try. I remember it like yesterday. Walking into that theatre and smelling the scent of popcorn. There was a short line in front of the room where I was to watch the film because people were trying their best to get in on time. I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.

There was not a single scene in this movie where I thought: maybe this isn't a great film or maybe this was a waste of time. Every single moment was another awesome moment and Leonardo and Kate's interaction with each other on screen felt genuine and real. I love this film now, and I expect I'll continue to love it as time goes on. It's become a classic and a definite must-watch for movie-goers of all ages!"
2021-03-02,shambrinkhalid,"I absolutely loved this movie in every single way possible. It's an absolute masterpiece. Makes you fall in love with ship named Titanic. A perfect balance of tragedy, romance and drama. It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears."
2021-02-26,igdddpn,"I'm very picky about romantic movies, call me childish but I practically despise most of them but I can truly say without a doubt this is one of the greatest movies of all time. Watch this regardless of what your favourite genres are, watch this if your just a fan of awesome movies. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said, if you haven't watched it already, what are you doing?"

2021-02-24,vangamer,"Top 7 Takeaways from Jim Cameron's Titanic:

7. In a true maritime disaster story, including a potential rescue ship (let's call it the California) that failed to act with tragic consequences adds no drama at all and must be ignored in the screenplay. 6. Ignoring the California may also be useful if the film has a short running time - say, only 3 hours. 5. People in 1912 spoke and thought exactly like people in the 1990s. 4. Rich people are bad. 3. Poor people are good. 2. Being trapped below decks on a sinking ship lacks drama - ensure a lead character is also chained during the sinking. 1. Never waste time researching historical events if developing a film on them

As a longtime Titanic buff I walked out of this mess - I only regret not leaving sooner."
2021-02-23,safenoe,
2021-02-23,matthewssilverhammer,"It opens tense before Cameron imperceptibly removes that tension. Then the iceberg appears, & the film is full steam ahead. I'm an easy scare when it comes to the dangers of water, & when the lower decks begin filling with water, it's terrifying. Then when the lights finally go out on the upturned ship...breathtaking. A corny & enormously effective reminder that even though money can give you power in countless ways, we're all equal in the eyes of God and nature."
2021-02-22,sanjev-24589,"When the movie got released, I was 10 years young and being non-english speaker, I didn't understand the dialogues and didn't like it as it had no action scenes as well. But as I turned 17, I watched it again and was mesmerized, touched and drained with tears. AND THE STORY CONTINUES TILL DATE AND WILL FOREVER......"
2021-02-21,pmtelefon,"Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet's less than thrilling nude scene."
2021-02-21,alhrbijawad,
2021-02-20,PickleMania,"This is a timeless classic and an outstanding film that truly has it all, one that a person could watch again and again. I'm still disappointed that Gloria Stuart and Kate Winslet didn't win Oscars. If one doesn't like this film -- and evidently there are some here who didn't -- then you have poor judgment and terrible taste. Perhaps superhero movies are more your style and speed or something equally mindless.

My great-grandparents, John Pillsbury Snyder and his wife Nelle, were survivors of the Titanic (they were first class passengers on their honeymoon) and although they died before I was born, the story of their ""Titanic experience"" was relayed to me as I was growing up. From what I heard about them, they remind me a great deal of the characters of Jack and Rose. Perhaps I'm romanticizing them, but there are similarities between the two couples. I can't help but wonder what they would have thought of this film."

2021-02-04,koed-05319,"By far the best movie of all time. Titanic has everything you need, Love, Drama, Action, Suspense and etc. You already know what's gonna happen but the great thing about titanic is how James Cameron placed was able to place a Romeo and Juliet story inside the ship and keep you on the edge of your seat as the story progresses. There is a reason why Titanic won 11 Oscars from the history of the ship to the amazing acting of the chosen cast and choice of music presented on screen. Titanic in my eyes is the greatest romance film ever made."

And I guarantee I'm going to watch it again someday. This film just never get old. The massage it's really strong: it wants to show you to always cherish every moment you have with your loved one. Not only husband, wife, your lover, but also to your friends, your family, your son, your dogs (since there lots of scene they bring up abt dog in there). Even your job when you actually live for and by it. It's not only about romance between Jack and Rose. It's about all the emotion"

Beautiful scenery, well performed characters and a story that will never get you asleep. You will feel through the whole movie that you are aboard the ship and are a part of the voyage. If you haven't seen this movie and have 3 hours available for a movie, a choose titanic and get a movie experience by nothing else!"
2021-01-03,famous_a_2000,"This movie is without questioned great!! I find myself looking at it more than once; looking at the highlights; intrigued with the story as if I were there (thank GOD that I wasn't!!) I also rooted for Jack and Rose. Rose didn't love Cal. Rose was being pressured to marry him. A big message was being sent when we see Rose ready to kill herself because of how trapped she was. Her mom was pressuring her for one. Like Jack, ""I know how the world works"" when a man has nothing to offer a woman.....especially when he's compared to a man who can give her the world. But, just like the movie with a similar storyline, The Notebook, a woman like Rose has to ask herself ""what do you want?"" Like so many others I was glad to see Jack win Rose over. But unlike so many others, Jack's death didn't sadden me the most. Normally after living through and watching a big drama like this his death would have saddened me the most. But unlike so many I haven't forgotten that this is so true of a story!! Jack and Rose didn't exist. But Capt. Smith, the band, Isador & Ida Krauss, Thomas Andrews, and other characters who died on screen in the sinking did.....and so did 1500 plus people back in 1912. That so saddens me more; especially since it seems like the poorer passengers weren't able to get on a life boat. Molly Brown also existed. And researching real life coverage, Molly Brown really did want to go back and see if she could rescue more. I honor all of those who perished. The love story that should have been told should be that of the Krauss': Isador and Ida. Ida could have boarded a life boat be she didn't want to live with out her true love of many many years. I write this review because I was surprised to see, on YouTube, the high number of people who acted like they were more sad about Jack's death than anything! Still an awesome movie about a serious piece of history."
2021-01-03,divyanshuparganihaedu,Amazing love story from a disaster. It depicts the emotional impact of disaster.
2021-01-02,pommeranian,"Titanic, dear Titanic. This was the second movie ever that I cried for after Romeo and Juliet. This was the only movie ever that I cried UNCONTROLLABLY. The sounds and effects are so apt to the storyline and moods. Zane acted his role with devastating and masterly demeanour, Kate portrayed her role of the unwilling bride impeccably. Celine Dion's ' My heart will go on' just adds defiant hope in the face of enormous tragedy. Then to think that the Titanic wasn't just a movie but a re- enactment of a real life event made me cry like a baby that first day I watched it. James Cameron is simply amazing as a director. He's one of the very best."

With eleven Oscars to choose from (including Best Picture and Best Director for James Cameron), ""Titanic"" is one of the most impressive films of all time! This planetary success has truly been a social phenomenon, around a now world famous couple: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet! The story obviously traces the famous story of the sinking of the Titanic, coupled with a magnificent and overwhelming love story with a luxury of special effects and endless visual discoveries! The song written by James Horner and sung by Cèline Dion remains one of the most beautiful love songs there is! Plus, ""Titanic"" proves that sophisticated rigging and virtual imaging can intelligently fuel a flamboyant story! In any case, we are not ready to forget the famous kiss between Jack and Rose at the bow of the Titanic in a feeling of freedom and rocked by the romanticism of the setting sun! The loves of this teenage couple make this magical and timeless moment even more poignant ..."

2020-12-20,proud_luddite,"This film mixes history (the sinking of the great ship in 1912) with fiction (a story of star-crossed young lovers on the ship: one, an artist with limited income; the other yearning to abandon the stuffiness of her upper-class background and a shallow fiancé).

The 3-D re-release of this film was even more enjoyable the second time. The special effects are phenomenal. The scenes of the sinking ship are perfectly orchestrated and some images can't leave the mind such as the many bodies in the sea after the sinking. Seeing this film after 2001 is eerie; scenes of people jumping off the ship are reminiscent of the destruction of the World Trade Centre.

The love story in the first half works well - mainly because of the fine work by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates also makes the most of a small role.

This is not to say the film is without flaws in the story. Did people really use the middle-finger gesture back in 1912? A rescue scene was perfectly directed but was also far-fetched. Also, the modern-day character who narrates the story in flashback fails to say what happened to one of her relatives.

The story does well in exposing the injustices imposed by the upper-class whose descendants would be called ""the one per cent"" a century later. Their stuffiness is also exposed with good humour. But sometimes, the soullessness seems exaggerated.

But these flaws don't dilute the great impact of this film. James Cameron's best work is in his directing rather than his writing. This is one of the rare big-budget Hollywood films of the past three decades that truly lives up to its expectations of greatness. - dbamateurcritic

2020-12-20,eulucasg,"The greatest film of all time is already made. Incredible and remarkable, Titanic is able to divide the cinema history on parts: before its release and after its release. What an action."
2020-12-12,numenorsniper-66396,"I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.

Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean. But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.

It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.

I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.

Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others."
2020-12-07,nayansh,"According to me, this film is simply the best. None other film made such an emotional impact on my heart. This film will always be remebered as a 'masterpiece'. I don't have words for my emotions towards this film. Words are less for such an excellent 'masterpiece'. I can just say that this will be my favourite film forever."
2020-12-05,mrreed-17210,"It certainly has its flaws. Mainly in dialogue (occasionally) but this film is wildly entertaining and thus being a 3 hour movie it doesn't really stagger. You feel the true journey of the ship and not just it's final moments above water. Leo and Kate are great in this. King Kathy bates is also perfect. The set, costumes, make up, music, visuals/cinematography, directing all wonderful. It's a great classic film that presents itself as powerful as the ship appeared to be. Even though the ending isn't what a Leo fan girl wants it does allow you to feel more of what the survivors feel wondering if their loved ones survived or if they knew they hadn't. James Cameron is always ambitious with his films but this one is distinguishing. Not the best love story ever but defiantly an iconic one. Knowing how much time and love James Cameron put into making this film and researching it makes you appreciate the film so much more."

I recommend this film to everyone who is a movie lover."
2020-11-18,saeedahmedsasoli,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.

First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.

Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.

The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself."
2020-11-16,yashkumar-15618,"""Titanic""(ship of dreams)

It's one of the greatest movie of all time Story is really amazing or heart touching how the ship was sunk it was heartbreaking based on true event

Especially cast :

Rose and Jack what a wonderful chemistry has been portrayed in the movie these two characters played their role extremely amazing movie also reflects the class differences where elite dominant and poor has to sacrifice. Credit goes to James Cameron his direction or selection of characters Titanic will remain unforgettable."

Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.

They took our breath away."

2020-10-26,ayushparasar,It's a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. Period. I pity those who haven't watched it yet or didn't like it.
2020-10-23,vittoriocosanostra,"So, I think everyone knows, but in 1997 one of the most successful films of all time was released. And, it's called Titanic, and it was directed by James Cameron. This film won 11 Oscars in 1997 (including the best film) and had a box office success of titanic grandeur, one of the biggest in history, critically acclaimed, adored by the public and revolutionary for its special effects. Well, despite its undeniable legacy, there are reasons that, obviously, Titanic is not as perfect and wonderful as many people think, and that it does not deserve its Oscars or be selected as one of the best films of all time. The Oscar for best picture should definitely have gone to the fantastic L.A. Confidential, and that movie is way better than this silly melodramatic crap."
2020-10-22,putahw-40997,"Before I saw titanic I heard it was nominated for 10 plus academy awards. Also I heard rave reviews. So I figured it must be a great movie.

It has been more than 50 times I watched this movie, the first time I watched this movie when I was 7 years old on the Indonesian TV program, the porn scene was deleted in my country so that's why I could watched the movie at that young age.

Everytime I watched the movie was never bored or sick of it. I enjoy a lot the romance storyline in this movie but there was a biggest mistake on Titanic scene.. The scene that still looks like a computer technique and is a little bad is when the water sucks on the Titanic ship. I could say that the computer technique in this movie is still less than perfect... However, Titanic is a true legend to be remembered for us.. Great job for all of yous!"

""Romance"" happens to be one of the movie genres. The two main characters were meant for each other. They were in love. It's touching! I wanted them to be together forever. I was mainly interested in the ship: Titanic. It was the biggest ship in the world at that time. The movie depicts it very well. Let's not forget the music in Titanic. It's probably the music which brings you into tears. The movie is very long though. Titanic was the biggest movie in box office. It's an ever popular movie. A lot of people like Titanic."

It is waaay too long and surprisingly bland. It could be compared to the Poseidon Adventure, an epic ship sinking disaster movie, but it decided to focus on the love story of the two protagonists. For me that was a poor choice, it could have been a drama of high tension.

But no. Just the worlds longest romance novel."
2020-09-27,heyimmyx,"Titanic is one of those movies that stays with you for life. Sure, the romance could be soppy at times, but this doesn't deny the fact that this movie is a masterpiece. Never have I seen a film with so much vigour and passion, entirely devoting itself to the horrors of that one tragic night. The movie is an experience rather than a viewing ; You get so involved with this isolated society at sea, as well as the characters, relationships and barbarity they experience. Firstly, it's worth praising the astounding set production, design and costumes. These all helped give us a beautiful, classic image of people at the time, as well as the splendour of the Titanic. The movie makes full use of its editing and cinematography to help convey the story in a more personal way. Every emotion the characters experience, we experience too, and this is largely thanks to the filmography. For example, the last half of the movie when the Titanic is sinking, utilises effective editing and videography, from its suspenseful action shots to the more sombre and touching scenes. The performances were mostly good. Unfortunately sometimes I did find Kate Winslet's acting slightly annoying and over melodramatic, although the screenplay could be widely to blame. Leo was impeccable with his cheeky demeanour and charming looks. It's to be said that Leo and Kate have captivating chemistry throughout, and I have no distaste in saying this is one of the greatest love stories ever told. The movie had set up Jacks and Rose's romance so well in the first half, and we had become so attached to their story, that by the second half we are completely glued to our seats and praying for the survival of the two main leads. In this sense the movie is very clever in sucking us into the relationship between these two characters. I loved the movies strong focus on the different treatment of the upper and lower classes, whilst exposing the egotistical and narcissistic nature of rich men like Cal, thus commentating on the unfairness of social class. His character was very well written, as he comes across as incredibly intimidating and possessive throughout *shivers*. It amazes me how a movie based on the Titanic has come to create a entirely different story of its own. The last half of the movie is what truly makes this a masterpiece. The sinking is told in great detail from beginning to end, portraying the slow descent into chaos and death. The atmosphere was filled with tragedy and sorrow, and never faltered in keeping us gripped the entire time. The mixture of sadness, despair and loss of life makes this an incredibly powerful yet disastrous look at the sinking of the Titanic. This movie succeeds because of the profound and overwhelming mixture of emotions we experience. We laugh, we despair, we swoon, we cry ; The movie transports us right into the action as if we were there. Overall, although this movie has problems, I can't deny that this is a staple in global cinema and is extremely enjoyable. I will never forget my first time watching it, as it was the first time I had ever felt so strongly about a film. It would be rude for me to rate it lower than a ten. Highly recommend!"
2020-09-27,sauravjoshi85,"Titanic is a drama romantic movie directed by James Cameron and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Late Bill Paxton.

To be honest the movie is a milestone in the history of cinema and I am in no position to review this masterpiece.

This movie is been viewed by millions of people across the globe and the viewership must be in billions but still whenever you see the movie it feels fresh and refreshing.

Acting is great by the very young Kate and Leonardo. Billy Zane played a part so well that viewers start hating him whenever he appears onscreen. Kathy in the role of a softhearted rich women and Fisher in the role of a woman showcasing her false pride is effective.

Screenplay is good and gripping although gets little slow in between but still it will not make you feel that the length of the movie. Cinematography is wonderful. Climax is beautifully shot and is emotional.

Overall this is one of the most beautiful romantic movies made in the history."

I am very disappointed in James Cameron, who is responsible for one of my all-time favorite movies (T2). As a result of the horror of having to sit through this waste of celluoid, I vowed to never watch any movies made after the year 2000, and am very happy with that decision."

2020-09-17,saifshormee,"The Titanic is a mystery to human kind of this generation and it has always been and it will always be one of that such. But the movie released by James Cameron called ""TITANIC"" is a fascinating movie. Within short let me summarise my experience with Titanic as a whole.

First of all; Titanic has a mysterious background and its a fact based movie. So people are always curious about such a mystery of the Titanic and what happened to it back in 1912 while it was sailing her first journey towards New York. No one knows the exact answer and the estimated death toll but by seeing the movie I found it was so emotional to accept such a loss of so huge number of people at a time. Moreover the starring by Leonardo Di Caprico and Kate Winslet is a wonderful duo. Moving forward; the story itself was wonderful. Besides the chemistry of the hero Leonardo and Heroine Kate was so enchanting and wonderful. Jealous Billy Johnson who wanted to marry Kate all throughout the movie was the ultimate villain of the movie..

The movie was a complete package. There were romance; history; technological applications; emotions; actions all together. Such a must watch movie it is.

The movie was casted on the verge of 20th century but it is still a wonderful movie to acknowledge and feel exciting. I think it is such a worth movie for watching alongside friend together...."
2020-09-17,munifrafi,"I am incredible devotee of sentimental film and I'm enthused about the historical backdrop of the Titanic When I was a young person I originally observed the film ,the film delivered in 1997 yet I previously considered this to be a 14-year-old . I have been establishing for it and discovered it has been delivered in different nations. I actually this film when I was more youthful and realize that even this age would truly appreciate it. the story, the symbolism, the characters, the score and the sheer exhibition, all things considered, 'Titanic' was an occasion, not only a film. There was nothing similar to it previously, and there has been in no way like . Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both moderately obscure entertainers at the hour of the film's unique delivery, sparkle as Jack and Rose, two youngsters from far edges of the social range who are united by destiny against the setting of perhaps the best misfortune. The primary hour acquaints us with the fundamental characters that we will go back in time with, and glancing through their eyes as they wonder over the wonders of life, and the progression of innovation. The remainder of the film is unadulterated energy, delight, sorrow, anticipation, and so on, and it has. Jack and Rose inevitably succumb to one another, and their affection is superb; at long last Cameron has gotten a genuine love relationship down on film. I continue watching this film at any rate 2 times each year. I know the content and each scene forwards and backwards. The Soundtrack is additionally incredible. It's a disgrace that the creation cut the last scene with 'David's Dialog In Prison'. Interestingly, this discourse is accessible in the Sound track The acting is great. The film was very elegantly composed and no cost was saved in resurrect Titanic. Everything looks as exquisite as it would have on the genuine Titanic. Portions of the story might be a piece buzzword yet the film is still truly agreeable"
2020-09-14,sumayajaman,"It's 2020 and I still watch this movie sometimes and I am pretty sure that people are gonna keep watching this movie for the next 50 years and while watching this they will still feel that same emotion that they felt when they watched this movie for the first time. This movie still in the top 3 of the list of highest grossing movies of all time even after 23 years.

I just re-watched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.

No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.

James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.

This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.

The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many. Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.

Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you."

2020-08-03,DanielStephens1988,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.

I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.

Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.

Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.

Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.

So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.

Great movie that sill holds up all these years. RIP James Horner & Bill Paxton"

2020-07-22,armozaffari,Titanic is a beautiful film. it was famous film. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority. Titanic is movie for every time and it's most popular movie. I saw thats in 1998 with my friends of university in my home with my first desktop computer. the movie is on CD and played with CD Rom. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio are very good actor. they are super stasr .
2020-07-21,benblankenship-20805,"One of my all time favorites , deserves a much higher rating . There is no romantic movie that could rival it . James Cameroon's crafting of Titanic, and Leonardo and Kate's acting will never age . Left an emotional impact for days ."
2020-07-17,ferencegrizzal,"This film doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

I've been an IMDb user for a long time and over the years I've matured in my personal rating system. Since there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, I only rate 10/10's to movies I personally love. Usually my 9's are objectively better made films than my 10's. That being said.

I believe this film is as close as you can get to a perfect film. I wish people would appreciate the craft of this film even if it's not your story. Just like Lord of the Rings or Goodfellas, this film is goes above and beyond just telling a story. It gives you an experience.

I think it deserves a spot in the top 250!

Who's with me? Up you're rating by one point! You know she deserves it. She may be 23 years old but isn't she a dish when she's on screen?"

You get the Titanic, a heart-wrenching love story with fantastic acting and sensational scores that touched audiences across the globe."
2020-07-13,baileycrawly,"There isn't much that can be said about James Cameron's Titanic that hasn't been said by the cast & crew, the audiences or the hours upon hours of bonus content that accompanies every release of the film for the last 15 years.

Titanic is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The sets are gorgeous and look exactly like the images of the Titanic, James Horner's score perfectly compliments the stunning visuals and tone throughout the film, the acting (particularly, of course, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) is second to none, the camera work James Cameron does throughout the movie helps to make the movie feel truly epic and heartbreaking. It's a perfectly balanced film that features a spontaneous love connection (with the chemistry to match it), but also doesn't take away from the truly tragic elements of the Titanic.

It's a movie that is both sensationalized to suit Hollywood and the film-going public of its time and sensitive to the reality of its subject matter when it needs to be. It's like there's a switch that is flipped, as soon as the very real and horrific events of the Titanic begin to transpire on the screen, it switches to a reflection of the tragedy of the time in a respectful manner. The love and admiration James Cameron has for the ship is extremely evident as the film goes on, and he managed to craft a perfectly balanced story.

It's an endearing film and a great way to ensure that the public always remembers what happened on the RMS Titanic. Of all the film adaptations (live-action and animated) that exist, this one is definitely the definitive, go-to version. It holds your interest with its perfect pacing and leaves you on the edge of your seat."

2020-07-12,carlhannan-18311,"How is this not in the top 250? This movie was breathtaking and inspiring. My new favorite! The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other. In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much more than is seen on the surfce. The cast was well picked, I cannot think of any actor or actress who would have played the roles better. James Cameron did an impecible job of being detail oriented when it came to the true events that took place in 1912. Additionally, the movie was so well done that while watching, it feels as though you are transported to the actual event. MASTERPIECE"
2020-07-11,itscalvinbowers-87021,"It makes me question the legitimacy of modern-day film criticism when I see films like this constantly getting thrown under the bus for a supposed ""lack of substance"". The discussion surrounding the medium as a whole has been spat on for years due to the ludicrous mentality that big budget blockbusters somehow have less validity than arthouse cinema or anything else outside of the usual wide release theater-fare. All genres deserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with one another, as they're all pieces of art and should be appreciated as such.

James Cameron's 'Titanic' released in 1997 and became an instant classic, though a somewhat controversial one. It shattered every record imaginable and won countless awards for its bold style, immaculate set design, and groundbreaking everything. It was huge, and the film itself compliments that sentiment. The biggest boat in the world, the greatest love story ever told, and the most tragic disaster of the century. The sheer scale and spectacle of this film is incredible. It was massive, and even with an industry now focused on world ending events and apocalypses of all shapes and sizes, it still remains massive today.

'Titanic' follows Rose, a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who, despite her luxurious life, is unsatisfied and longs for something more. She meets and subsequently falls in love with Jack, a poor artist who won his ticket in a game of poker. A very basic setup, right? One that we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference is, this is the one that everyone remembers. This is what separates this love story from other love stories: It's memorable. Clichés aren't bad, I honestly believe that they're essential to storytelling. It's what you do with them that matters. James Cameron takes a somewhat basic love story about two people from different worlds falling in love with each other despite their differences and puts it inside a disaster of monumental scale. We all know that the unsinkable ship will inevitably sink, but its everything before that - the characters - the buildup - the overconfidence that all the passengers and crew uphold - it plants the idea in your head that maybe, just maybe, it'll be different this time. The events that transpire before the sinking is what makes it all the more impactful. If it was just a random ship filled with people you don't care about, it wouldn't affect you. Instead, it's a real world tragedy with characters that you've spent hours watching grow and evolve.

Themes of perseverance, freedom, and love are represented beautifully here. Images like the violinists trying to maintain a sense of duty and composure amidst the chaos will forever be ingrained in my head. My Heart Will Go On by Céline Dion is not only a beautiful piece of music, but it connects to what I think is, the central theme of the film. Remembrance. Push forward, but never forget. Rose promises Jack to survive and live her life, but she'll always remember her short, but magical time on the ship all those years ago.

Despite the groundbreaking nature of 'Titanic', that's not what first comes to mind when talking about this film. It's the characters, the journey, and the story that's captured the hearts of many moviegoers and film fans alike. That's what was discussed when it released, that's what we discuss now, and that's what will be discussed for generations to follow."
2020-07-11,Calicodreamin,"There's no doubting that the titanic is an epic movie for the ages. Beautiful cinematography and acting, such chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. The costuming and set design are beyond comparison, creating stunning visuals and bringing the story to life. The gravity of the disaster is conveyed beautifully and never ceases to make me weep endlessly. My only faults are that Jack could have definitely fit on that door, and old rose was dead wrong for tossing that necklace in the ocean."

2020-06-27,diggnuts,"Generic story set against a historical tragedy. Pretty easy to fill in the gaps, add some (for the time) expensive advanced CGI and let the marketing department take over.

I was able to ignore this movie for more than 2 decades, but alas, due to work related circumstances, I did eventually see it and I neither hate it nor like it. It's just middle of the road generic filler fluff with no substance.

I'm beginning to suspect Cameron's most valued skill is choosing his marketing people, because his film are generally not that great.

And yes.. There was indeed plenty of room..."

2020-06-22,izzyymotleyy,"I usually do not write reviews for movies, I'll rather just rate them. But this film is different. I NEED to talk about this film. I've loved this film ever since I was 6-7 years old, and I haven't stopped loving it since. Titanic is a masterpiece beyond levels. When it comes to the first half, were introduced to a romance/love story, which is just the heart of the movie. The film then needles through the past and present with breathtaking transitions. Then the second half of the film is basically a disaster movie, which some of the most heartbreaking moments introduced to film. Everything is so believable and so atmospheric. James Cameron is so talented as a director and as a writer when it comes to this film, his talent was very much noticed. This film is just....so masterful and so well made. Words can't express how much I adore this film, but it's just my favorite and I wish more movies were this well made in today's field."
2020-06-22,sherlock-CC,"In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the poignant love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely sensational. The story is based on the search for ""the heart of the ocean"", using the narration of a shipwrecked surviving old man Ruth as an introduction, and using flashbacks to introduce the audience to a mood of involuntary role replacement. The characters who follow the story look as if they were there."
2020-06-20,lshu-04094,"An emotional disaster that strikes the heart. In addition to the interaction between the male and female owners, I was deeply impressed by the two old people lying on the bed in the third class cabin before the ship sank. When the sea was about to submerge, my mother slapped two children to sleep. The music played all the time on the ship. When the disaster came, the captain and designer who died calmly made me cry."

2020-06-08,TheHonestCritic,"""Titanic"" (1997), okay, before you all freak out and get enraged, I will say this. James Cameron has a boatload of talent (NO PUN INTENDED), as a writer and a director. He has written and directed some phenomenal films! But, ""Titanic"" in my opinion, is by far his worst movie. It has an overlong and convoluted storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. This ""film"" is 195 minutes in length. Now, the length of a movie can make or break it. I don't mind a long movie if the storyline keeps me hooked all the way through. The basic plot behind this ""film"" is that there's a love story and the Titanic sinks. A simple story like this should warrant 100-120 minutes max to express the storyline. Film Making 101: if you're planning on making a lengthy film, then you better be sure that you know what you're doing. Just because a movie is long, does not always guarantee it's going to be good. Remember the cardinal rule: less is more! You always want to leave your audience asking for more in the end. Therefore, your storyline will have a stronger impact. As for the acting, it's overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, there are two standouts though. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose are the only two that seem to actually be trying. Both of them are great actors! But, a poorly written storyline impeded them from truly giving it their all and allowing them to shine. Such a shame! Both of these two actors, along with the majority of the rest of the cast are great actors and actresses in other movies. What's their excuse here? Finally, the soundtrack is just a cliched, dull and predictable mess. However, there is one standout song from the score that isn't too bad. The song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" written by James Horner and then performed by Celine Dion is actually well-done. As for the rest of the music in this ""film"", it's just generic and boring. There are only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. The Titanic set is very well constructed and the rest of the locations give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. ""Titanic"" is a boring and lengthy ""movie"". Probably one of the worst things about it is that you know what's going to happen in the end right from the beginning. Talk about spoiling your own film! Sorry, James Cameron..... ""Titanic"" is just nothing but a jumbled mess. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Don't bother watching ""Titanic"", I don't care how much a film makes at the box office. Just because a movie makes a lot of money doesn't always mean it's automatically going to be a masterpiece. Awards mean nothing, because at the end of the day, what's most important is what you think. I just wish I could get those 195 minutes of my life back!"
2020-06-07,dilipbts,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!

Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!"
2020-06-07,climbever,"The most over rated movie I've ever seen, I think DiCaprio and Kate winslet are great actors but there is no chemistry between them whatsoever, I don't get why it won so many Oscars that year, considering you had LA confidential, Boogie nights, Good will hunting, all of which are far superior movies. So take away the ending of titanic and it's a complete borefest."

It shows that love doesn't understand social differences. It shows that richness is not enough for full life. Secondly, the cast is great, Leonardo DiCaprio does his work perfectly, Kate Winslet is the brilliant of film. Thirdly, action itself is awesome, it looks like Cameron destroyed the ship really.

2020-06-02,krational,"The night is as deep as the sea. I lie quietly on the bed and look at the Titanic. I don't know how many times I watched it. It seems that this has become a habit when I need to cry. This time, I was moved by a villain named Karl. It always seems to hit the spotlight on the protagonist, Jack and Rose's love is undoubtedly sullen, every time he hates Karl for disrupting selfishness, wasting the chance of escape again and again on jealousy and conspiracy. From his perspective, I think I saw something new and wrote it out to share with you. The first time was at the beginning of the film, he walked into Rose's room and saw the paintings she had collected. There is no doubt that he does not understand or care about art. He is a thorough businessman, even at the last moment of the film he is still a businessman. I looked at him and said with a smile, Rose liked these paintings, what Picasso or the like. It seemed to be full of disdain and mockery, but there was a bit of bitterness mixed in that mockery. He couldn't get into her world, he couldn't understand her, or art. He went on to say that she had to bring these paintings every time she went out. For the first time, I felt that maybe he didn't love Rose not only because he needed a glamorous and young wife, but also love. Although this love was also full of a strong merchant atmosphere, it was because he was powerless to change and unconscious. Arrived. If he just asked her to make the vase around him, then he would not care about her preferences, would not labor to bring her paintings with every trip, and would not understand her habits so much, because he cared about her. Then, looking down, they went into the upper class as usual until he saw Jack, who saved Rose, on the deck. I don't know if it's too much of my heart. After his false thanks, I clearly saw his watchful glance at Jack, then turned around and embraced Rose immediately. The look was complicated and cold. He probably understood what was going on. Out of an instinctive vigilance, he felt that this person was different from Rose, so he didn't care about the gentleman's demeanor and was about to leave Luo ribbon here. When the crew proposed to give Jack some compensation, he invited him to dinner in the first class. Personally, he thought it was a little trick of love. He wanted him to be ugly, and hoped Rose could find him good by comparing with this poor boy, and The essence of the businessman is also the most vivid, he can thank him without paying a penny. I can't compare which of these two reasons is more important. The emotional and monetary factors are complicated. This is Karl. However, things in the world often go against expectations. The more he wants to attack him, the more he wants to separate them, but instead promotes their inseparable life and death. Next came the third-class cabin party. I have to say that Rose really did a little over here. Whether it is a man full of possessiveness, he can't bear his fiancee to openly go in pairs with another person on the ship. In full view, she took his hand and turned happily, hugging, like a pair of lovers. He still maintained his gentlemanly style, waiting for her to come at night, thinking that she would explain to him well, but instead of waiting for him, he not only waited for him, but she drank tea casually the next day and said, ""I'm too tired ""At that moment, he couldn't help it, he saw no sign of regret. When I saw him overturn the table, I felt that he was no different from any young man in love, young and impulsive. There is no proper way to save his woman. But this time he didn't touch Rose, he let his anger lie on the table, and silently warned her not to mess up. And at night, he came to her again and took out the famous heart of the ocean. He was not an apology person, but he seemed to persevere by her side. He put a precious gem on her neck, which was a silent apology and weight. He was a businessman, and his apology was calculated. He gave her the gem in advance, and he just wanted to restore her heart. But he really didn't understand her. He also doesn't understand love. The next thing got farther and farther away from his expectations. When he saw the painting, he just wanted to tear it off! However, the essence of the businessman made him come up with a conspiracy. He always wanted to get the most profit for the smallest price. As a result, he succeeded and Rose returned to him. He sent her to the lifeboat, but she eventually discovered his conspiracy and chose to go to the poor boy. He was almost mad and asked the servant next to him to find her. He still wanted to take her. He went back and took the necklace and money. Can you say he was selfish? Still smart? Seeing that she was on the deck again, she was waiting to get on the lifeboat. She was still closely following him, still wearing his clothes. He was really dizzy and immediately forced her to put on his coat, but forgot that Diamonds. She refused to enter the lifeboat because of the poor boy. He was willing to lie and coax her into the boat at this time. I was moved by him at this moment. When he smiled and comforted her that I had arranged it, I promised you to take Jack away too. I think he really loves Rose. The only purpose of his lies is to coax her into the boat. Of course he knows what it means to get on the boat. When the two men in Rose's life looked at her on the railing and smiled goodbye to her, what was the difference between the two men? Their only moment of unification was for her life, and their only common denominator was loving her. Rose finally chose to jump the ship, and when he died with Jack, Carl's last chance to board the ship was in front of him, but he gave up. We often only see Rose give up the boarding opportunity a few times and choose to be with Jack, but we don't see Carl do the same thing. Rose gave up twice and Carl gave up twice. Rose is for Jack, Carl is for Rose. In the end, he was young and full of emotions. He was finally stunned by jealousy and shot the pair of lovers. If his essence is so selfish and so cruel, how can he be so crazy? He really wished he could die with Jack. The bullets ran out, but none of them hit him. The expression that he was holding a gun but couldn't make a bullet was really desperate, so he gave up. In the end he found that the diamond was still given to her. In such an ironic way, he laughed and laughed at the drama of the matter. Laughing he could not hold either one, his two babies. I've been thinking about what Karl finally found among the survivors, whether it was Rose or Diamond. Rose had loved him crazily. He had done a lot of impulsive stupid things for her. Diamond was also what he always missed, representing the merchant's breath in his bones. He was right, those were his two babies, two babies that were lost forever."
2020-06-01,xuefeiding-92364,"In the background of Titanic shipwreck, the love between rose and Jack is an important stroke in the history of film. The movie not only narrates the love at first sight that spans the gap between the rich and the poor, but also sings an elegy for the touching story that life and death follow at the critical moment. At the same time, in the context of the shipwreck, countless characters on the Titanic face death, some of them are afraid of fear, some of them are calm, and some of them are also amazing."
2020-05-27,freemantle_uk,"Titanic was a pop culture phenomenon upon its release, breaking box-office and awards records. It obviously struck a chord.

Titanic was an old-fashioned romance that happened to be made by a man who used revolutionary techniques. The first half of the film was about two star-crossed lovers from different strata and the second was about the disaster. The setting was used to look at the different attitudes about class and wealth as well as tell an emotional human story. Whilst scenes of the disaster supply lots of peril and excitement.

Even though Titanic was a smash hit I doubt it made today because it was over three hours long and not based on a recognisable property. Studios want franchises and avoid making films over two and half hours."

2020-05-21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10"

To be able to share weal and woe with those you love, to breathe with each other, to embrace each other, to walk the last mile of life hand in hand, and then to disappear in the endless sea with the huge ship, to sleep in the bottom of the sea, this is far more happy and practical than to spend your life in vain! How should a person spend his or her life, no matter how short or long, this may be the main theme that the film director is always thinking about. It is not difficult to see that the hidden clue running through the back is the discussion on the value of life and the meditation on the way to choose life."

I often felt that I would die for a long time until the end of the world, when I fell down into the deep space with the cracked earth.

The Atlantic ocean is as deep as the sea, can not see the edge of the sea and stars, floating people are insignificant, it is really desperate to desolate.

I'm afraid of the sliver of silence when life sinks.

I fear the eternal defeat of nature.

What can we do? Then the earth rose, the volcano erupted, the lava became unyielding, and the ancient city was swallowed up. Mountains crumble. Villages and cities crumble. When the ocean roars, the hurricane is raging, the waves are high, and the island sinks?

I looked into that little screen, and there was fear. That piece of water, so far dare not touch.



Ten years later, this film has become the background color of time for me and most people.

I know every piece by heart, every line of dialogue, every movement, every fluctuation.

I use it as an example for many compositions and even English reading exercises.

Ten years. Any movie can not stand the time and the population such a rush, the plot has become allusions, the truth has become common sense.

Ten years. I went from primary school to college, and the hero and heroine went from their youth to their midlife crisis.

However, even if it is known to all, even if time has sifted it into a leak, no longer able to block any mystery, it is still a myth.

It is a myth that whenever we face it, we cannot help but shudder.

Because no matter how hard the heart is, it will bow in the face of extinguished life and melt in the face of eternal love.



I was holding the computer crying all over trembling, can not help but imagine that the cinema line, girls holding the boy's hand, a dialing you nong nong into the ground, hysterical to come out, the spectacular scene.

Yes, we are looking for masochism, to use the greatness and disaster of the screen to confirm their mediocrity and happiness.

Those couples don't know if they're going to end up together or if they're going to end up together. Ross and jack are going to be together forever. However, who in the beginning of love, did not like the pair of young people as desperate?

Sometimes life just doesn't think about the future.



What would have happened to rose and jack if they had both been saved in that disaster?

To tell you the truth, I thought about all the possibilities to keep them both alive, and even thought that if they hadn't met, maybe rose would have been on the lifeboat and jack would have been fucking sleeping on the board. But what happens when I survive, I really don't doubt.

There are more poor people answer: as in the revolutionary road, the marriage crisis ah, trivial life ah, buried passion ah, quiet old ah; Or because of class position did not combine at all (MAO probably read more). -- where to learn to see through the world of mortals.



Isn't it annoying to come up here and preach? I just don't understand why two people who died together can't live together. Once so fit, why will separate.

Don't tell me that it's easier to keep your job than to start one. There's nothing new under the sun. I just know how life goes on, and it goes on and on.

Have you ever loved it? Have you ever cried and laughed, no matter what? Ever gone off the deep end? You have not subverted life, life to subvert you.

And they, they loved so much. So close. So live and die together.

Perhaps sometimes life is a naked subversion, dream and passion will be old -- but, is old, not dead. Passion grows old, love never dies; Dream will be old, ideal die; Man grows old, but his heart never dies.

The scariest thing is, have not experienced old, began to fear death, have not loved, began to spit.

I still believe in the amazing beauty of life, even if I can't see it after a while.

To put it bluntly, I believe rose and jack will stay together for years, decades, and centuries to come. Just because old rose looks back, so beautiful.



Welcome you to say that I am naive absurd, also welcome you to continue to mature desolate.

Speaking of which, Titanic is the most wonderful romantic movie I have ever felt. It is like drinking honey wine, which is not to speak of.

This is a gorgeous to the extreme, making the human difficult to do the background, but also delusion breakthrough time and life and death to the eternal love.

Rose jumped up from the lifeboat and jumped to the window, the most beautiful for her bravery and greed.

I have spent all my luck to meet you in the moment of my life. To this day only to find, had breathed the air.

I'm one of those people with a little hope of survival, maybe without jack, but I'm still on thin ice."
2020-05-16,stephcollider,"Just recently saw this film again and I must saw it holds up! A friend was putting this film down and I couldn't disagree more. The effects still shine bright! The music is unforgettable, and Leo and Kate are just so lovely. It does get a little silly here and there, but those are just minor gripes. This movie gives you the feels!

Watch this movie if you have seen it, watch it, watch it, watch it!"
2020-05-16,nbutcher-69458,"This film is to teenage girls what the original Star Wars films are to teenage boys. It perfectly encapsulates the female monomyth - or the hero's journey - which is why it is such a classic and why it will always resonate through the ages. Other stories have tried to do a female monomyth, but Titanic nails it.

We know what happens to the Titanic, so the romance between Jack and Rose deserves special attention. Jack Dawson is to Rose what Obi-wan Kenobi was to Luke Skywalker: the mentor that taught you to be the hero you didn't think you could be. What makes Titanic special from many other romance stories is that Jack doesn't rescue Rose from her predicament. Inspired by Jack, Rose begins the story as a damsel in distress but by the end of her story she is no helpless damsel. There are some lessons here for men too - if they're paying attention.

The special effects for the Titanic were second to none. The Titanic - like the Death Star in Star Wars, is not only gorgeous but hangs menacingly over the film. The filmography of it's sinking is terrifying and incredibly effective.

In many ways, the Titanic itself is a metaphor for our own lives. We all start on a wonderful adventure when we are born - but at one point in our lives we *will* hit that iceberg and sink. What do we do onboard in the days, months, and years leading up to this? Titanic goes out of it's way to clearly suggest that class and wealth mean nothing when we're all going over the edge of that ship - and then, in light of all this, what is truly important? This film gives us that resolution too.

For all these reasons - notwithstanding the music - the film is a masterpiece of cinema. Brilliant in sheer spectacle, deep thematically, emotionally moving, and will be forever timeless.

I only docked it one point for excessive run-time, some hokey dialogue, and some unnecessary swearing."
2020-05-14,katievfoxley,Its a true story but one of my favourite love films. I can watch this over and over. It breaks your heart!!

2020-05-11,vanshikaagarwal-73510,"The film is a real-life tragic drama,enacted more than one thousand and fifty years ago,on the luxurious and invincible ship ""Titanic"",that struck an iceberg. It sank in the Pacific Ocean,with more than one thousand and five hundred passengers on board. The director ingeniously weaves a love story against the backdrop of this tragedy. It is the story of a poor girl 'Rose' ,who falls in love with a young boy 'Jack' , immigrating to American for work. Rose's mother,an ambitious woman wants her to marry a wealthy young man, traveling abroad the ship. The drama has the usual twists and turns ,with the wealthy man accusing Jack of stealing a diamond necklace"" The heart of the ocean"".

At the juncture the ship collides with an iceberg,and starts to sink gradually. There is a wild scramble ,as people behave like animals, for their awn self- preservation. The last scene is heart breaking as the hero succumbs in the icy water, to save his beloved.

The film has good cinematography and elaborate sets. The grandeur of the ship has been recreated,by actually constructing the same. The excellent camera work, and digital stereo sound effects, give a 'true to life's experience. Everything was perfect.

The film is realistic and strikes an emotional chord on the viewers, some of whom were moved to tears. On the whole, it is a well-made film offering wholesome entertainment and thrill, justifying the cost of one hundred million dollars that were into making it. Undoubtedly, it deserves the eight Oscar awards, and is a runway success."

Sad, beautiful, heartfelt.

And the one thing people don't appreciate is that it was told in the past tense. It was from the lens of Rose as an elderly women.

Just an overall classic movie with excellent scenes and amazing scripting."

2020-05-03,Raptorclaw155,"One of the interesting things about this film is that it's pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.

As it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic's interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it's no surprise that this film would be any different.

However, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there's also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.

There's also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship's lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.

One of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn't feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.

Despite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don't think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It's far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something."
2020-05-02,chengyiting,"Whether it is the method of filming or the face value of the male and female protagonists, they are all rare high-quality qualities! The beauty of the heroine made me want to worry about it. This movie is a rare masterpiece. It is no wonder that the director has won the award!"
2020-04-28,gilgongo1980,"The story was clear to everyone before seeing, apart from the romance of the two main actors. The plot was still sometimes exciting. You could cut the film by an hour, then it would have been easier for the audience."
2020-04-26,erbasataberk,"I am sure everyone has seen this movie in a part of their life. If you watched it when you were young, please watch it again because it is the defenition of a masterpiece. Altough Di Caprio and Winslet were on their early ages, they were fantastic. Chemistry was as good as it can be. Exquisite writing. When the movie is based on a real story it is harder to be creative. James Cameron did a spectacular job in writing and his world-class directing, because of him we are able to call this movie a classic. Amazing visual effects especially for 1997. It deserves every attention it has gotten. After all every one of 11 Oscars is not a suprise at all."
2020-04-26,colindrayton,"When the song 'Heart Will Go On' came on during this film all I could think about was Kate Winslet's breasts jiggling all over the place, hence 'her heart underneath those breasts going on'. I also like the positive outlook this film has on betting which makes me more comfortable with my gambling and Kate Winslet also looks a lot like my sister so that made Kate all the more sexy for my sausage and love balls."

2020-04-20,xuefeiding,"Cameron skillfully used the shipwreck of the ""century shipwreck"" Titanic as a traction, realism and romantic feelings complement each other, cleverly implanted romantic and Humanistic Love Tragedy, and created a magnificent film Titanic. In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the sad and beautiful love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely provocative and tearful. The story starts with the search for ""the heart of the sea"", with the narration of Ruth, an old survivor of the shipwreck, as the introduction, and uses the flashback to introduce the audience into the mood of an involuntary role replacement. It's wonderful to follow the characters."

The first sentence is Jack rescued Ruth from the railing said, is the first encounter shallow love. The second sentence is when life and death depend on each other Jack's advice to Ruth, never give up the hope of living, is love after love deeply.

It was a perfect choice to tell this story from a new but strong romance and love, giving the viewer a realization of how this must have been.

2020-04-11,q-85184,"I think that although the film focuses on love, it also reflects the ugliness of class relations When the Titanic was about to sink, almost all the opportunities for survival were reserved for the aristocratic class. The poor could only pray for the rest of the ship to give their children or face death silently This is a criticism of the ruling class of that era and a satire that the poor and the rich were treated differently"
2020-04-10,Mia-302,"The Heart of the Sea is a jeweled necklace. It is the color of the ocean. Most people would think it is precious but Rose, the main character, gets it as a gift and doesn't care about it. Rose's mother wants her to marry Caledon Hockley for the money. On the Titanic, Rose gets the Heart of the Sea as a gift from him.

It is interesting that the two main characters in this movie are in opposite places in their lives. Rose feels trapped. Rose's family comes from money. She meets and falls in love with a boy named Jack. Jack is poor, gambles, and moves around a lot. Rose starts to change after spending time with Jack. He is like a role model.

I would say age appropriateness for the movie is 9-10 and up. It has some sadness, a little bit of violence, and nudity. I rate it 8 out of 10 stars. I hope you enjoy the movie."

But now, it was completely moved by it, and it was deeply imprinted into the memory. Even when the fireworks were set off on New Year's Eve, I saw the fireworks rising, blooming, and falling in the dark night sky. I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People's feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age. After many years, the 11-time Oscar-winning ""Titanic"" can still travel through time and space and shake people's hearts."
2020-03-28,joncheskin,"Watched this movie for a second time recently with my 17-year-old son. He actually suggested the viewing, he heard about the movie and was curious. Rarely have I had a better entertainment experience with a family member.

Titanic is just simply awesome, a movie that you just sit back and marvel at. Photography, special effects, costumes, production are just incredible, with a real feel of authentic time travel back to 1912. Musical score also sweeping and emotional, of course with Celine Dion's favorite song and a wonderful orchestral sweep.

A little more controversial is the screenplay and love story, which some commentators have portrayed as trite and even amateurish. What saves this movie, and in fact turns it into an instant classic, is that the characters are much more universal than they appear at first glance, and really have a great chemistry. Leonardo Di Caprio's Jack is an underdog orphan that has suffered great personal hardship, Kate Winslet's Rose is a young woman of great spirit completely stifled by her family and her society. You really can't help but root for them, and the chemistry between the two is absolutely fantastic. Put this story in the midst of one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, and at the very least you have a very potent formula, even if it is not executed perfectly at every turn. Often my son and I were laughing at some of the cliches in the midst of being completely absorbed in the unfolding drama.

I recommend it to anyone, even those with a low tolerance for grossness (radiation sickness is shown in progressive stages, and it is not pretty). It's dark, depressing, and if you get into it you will definitely need to follow it up with a musical or cartoons just to lift your spirits again. Still, the subject matter is not something that can be portrayed positively even at a tv-movie level of realism."

2020-02-17,Offworld_Colony,"The problem with these iconic blockbusters that worm their way in to culture, is that their lasting image burned in to my brain is one of the fan culture, the parodies, the awards, the ripple of films influenced for decades after, and the legacy of the filmmakers and the technology going forwards, all which overshadow the actual merits of the film itself and eventually taint it in my mind; almost like a kind of warped reverse/retconned-hype.

Titanic is an elegant harmony of period drama and destruction porn. With a 70/30 split of the action in the back-end like theatre. Managing to weave his underwater interests in to a tragic love story in a Shakespeare vein gives it a quintessential classical Hollywood feel. There's some cheesy acting and dialogue but it's all in keeping with the blockbuster ethos; Cameron's on-the-nose dialogue (clearly trumped up by ghost-writers here) fits the classic nature of the film and produces some memorable, quotable lines.

Cameron clearly knows wonder and spectacle, but also attention to detail and minutiae; the examinations of the microcosm of class, the revelry in such feats of engineering and artistry. Titanic, adopting a sublimely classic structure, manages a marriage of all these elements very well. It jumps through time elegantly, crossing over tacitly also in to excavation drama and faux-biopic.

There's a tangible (read: expensive) earthy quality to the authentically constructed sets and meticulous and completely fashionable costumes. And the superb editing enhances the tactile nature of the film. Cameron really knows pacing in this film; always paced just right, never languid, never passing over the important moments, almost no scene that doesn't serve a purpose; the film's breathing room allows for many callbacks and twists and turns and it can be genuinely tense at times. Again, elegance is the word that comes to mind, a perfect synthesis on shooting and editing style and subject matter.

The audio has real range depending on where the characters are standing, I noticed archways or covered areas changing the aural landscape and it's got some properly wistful and hummable music (which you want in the theme) even if the music sometimes sounds like the start of the Home Alone theme, or whatever other Christmas move I kept seeing in my head when the music began.

The picture is superb. In fact it may be the best I've ever seen. It's a pristine image that looks like you're perring through the cleanest window you've ever seen. It's a masterclass in image reconstruction. The lighting is also lovely, timeless, pretty but not too saccharine, the night shots still impressive. The 3D is cautious but sumptuous. Never gratuitous and never party to ghosting or too many jarring planes of 3D image intersecting. It's clear that Cameron was always interested in framing his shots with many layers which lends itself perfectly for this kind od post-post-conversion. There's a mirror shot featuring Billy Zane and his Manservant that exhibit the quality of the original shooing and the 3D conversion all at once.

The effects still hold up, some are noticeable but not as jarring as some techniques used a decade later. At this time, effects; visual and special, motion capture, matte paintings, miniatures and CGI were all used and blended only when it would have looked its best, represented the best intention of the director. Watching the extras of Titanic alongside the extras of The Hobbit it's depressing how these effects work, particularly mocap and CGI that is now used largely to cut corners on set, or make up for a lack of script, or to cut costs.

In terms of acting, DiCaprio solidifies himself as a charming but cool, real and tangible loveable young tyke, his believable, youthful, effortless acting a joy to watch. Winslet goes through the best arc; her character perfectly embodying both the uptight and the energy of youth, she has real nuance and layers that come out of her character. But it's Zane that I love the most. He's superbly hilarious, watching him a riot, an actor understanding his role perfectly. I am fascinated by Zane who plays a man perfectly from his time; the relaxed air of privilege. He's not mean or evil, he just has edge; he's just exactly a product of the time and his class. He's not even a bad sport, with a knowing sense of humour and a desperate human element.

In conclusion, Titanic is a film that I couldn't see it that often, but when I've forgotten the clichés and the well studied beats of it, it's a surprising film of great technical prowess, with gravitas and charm by the bucket-load. It's memorable and a brilliant synthesis of themes and genres. It is expertly crafted cinema in the traditional sense. And in light of recent massive, world-altering tragedies it even takes on new light and new importance as a very raw and emotional product."
2020-02-09,hk-84771,"A spellbinding, moving and awe inspiring motion picture.

Even to be able to successfully make such a big scale movie is a feat in iteself. Particularly, the second half, showing the ship sinking is a great filmmaking achievement.

Besides, the film offers an audio-visual treat by virtue of its great settings, beautiful costumes and wonderful background score.

But even with all these features, the movie would have been superficial if the story wasn't poignant enough. Thankfully, the love story is one of its strongest aspects. I think there are two reasons why the love story is so touching and iconic:

1.)The idea of watching the romance between two charming young lovers on the grandest, most magnificent ship in the world is fascinating.

2.)On top of that, knowing that it's not too long before the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink,thus separating the two of them forever.

The ending is particularly remarkable. There are a few scenes towards the end which add great emotional depth to the ill-fated love story:The 101-year old rose dropping the diamond in the ocean, the camera moving through pictures of young rose while the old rose is asleep and finally that magical last scene- capturing the essence and spirit of the whole movie- in which the ship becomes alive and the two lovers reunite.

In a nutshell, Titanic is a great motion picture which is timelessly and universally appealing."

2020-02-04,0w0,"This movie is a romantic film, set in the backdrop of the historic sinking of the cruise ship named ""Titanic"". Even if you're not that into romantic movies, this movie still packs enough action and suspense to keep you from falling asleep. The CGI for the time was bleeding-edge and the fact that it was the biggest budget movie ever for its time truly shows. The movie is a spectacle and it's done extremely well.

The performances for Leo de Caprio and Kate Winslet isn't anything special but they still deliver believable performances as does the entire cast.

Even more than 20 years later, the movie is still extremely watchable and I honestly can't think of a better portrayal of the historic sinking of this massive ship. From the systematic flooding of the cabins below deck to the breaking and snapping of the entire ship into two pieces, its all done extremely well and it all seems very true-to-fact.

Overall an amazing cinematic experience and an even better portrayal of an historic event."

Keep in mind (your're listening to someone that acts like their inside of a coffin all the time). So when I watched this movie someone asked me: hey, why are you staring at the floor? As the person petted someone hair. But what they didn't know is that when rose and jack separated, I did want to convey it somehow. Meanwhile the man in front of me screams like a child and someone had their hand on the back of his neck."

2020-01-29,SamJamie,"Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

Titanic truly is the greatest film I've ever seen. The boat had a life of its own and as does the film. What can be said about the film that hasn't already been said? An absolute classic."
2020-01-27,seanmweldy,Favorite Movie! The first time I watched this i fell in love with the story. I have watched it countless times and is still not old.
2020-01-24,jusurf-14848,One of the most best life movie ever made in the 1997. I was 5 when the movie come out. And will always forever will be my favorite film in my life. Fall in love once with Titanic when I watch it for the first time. Every time I watch it always give me goosebumps.
2020-01-21,Jorge_Wo,I like it very much. It is belong to the movies that you never forget it.
2020-01-15,BA_Harrison,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).

James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.

A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.

It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?

9/10."

The movies that tell stories of true events are always good. But something about Titanic made it so special. I knew what was going to happen, but I still couldn't handle it. It kills me to think what everyone experienced. This movie certainly detailed what happened that day. I know I've said it before, but this is the greatest movie of all time. James Cameron is an incredible director, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were excellent, and the graphics were amazing.

2019-12-07,TheRothOfKhan,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since. Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life."

2019-11-13,xoxascott,"The movie would make a super mature person laugh because of how stupid it can be once in a while. However, it is well made and entertaining to watch with strong acting and good characters. The main message of the film is also fantastic. I must admit the movie is not my cup of tea but I can definetely see why other people would totally adore it."
2019-11-10,meissotruey,"This movie is like the source of life, it filled me with different emotions, I felt real warmness, I felt suspense, I felt empathy. It filled me with good emotions, refreshed my mind in some way, I absolutely in love with it. And I think, everything about this movie is great, EXCEPT scenes from ""nowadays"" : I can't see any emotions on the face of this old lady, I hate this thing, when she tells something and It feels like I SHOULD feel sorry for this non - acting bag with bones, because I KNOW that she is Rose, this is the point when me and you MOST feel sorry, cheap trick. No hate to this actress, but to the director, I just hate this useless old living. Nobody ever asked you to invite 87 year old actress, if you can't find any acting one, then cut this scene, use cosmetics, do anything that not harms the movie. I think that all those scenes spoils the great movie and without them it can be called a masterpiece. These people are useless, they take my time, they don't do anything, these scenes not ever look that great like Titanic story itself! All that they do is playing cheap emotional games "" feel sorry for me""; ""look at something you know"" and this is disgusting! I feel really mad about that part, and I feel sad for such a great movie. I would recommend you to skip all of them and enjoy this piece of art."

2019-10-25,blueangel-76133,"I'd like to proudly join the ranks of the minority who found this film to be a tedious, silly, childish serving of ridiculous pap interesting only to juvenile sensibilities. Aside from the presence of the genuinely talented DiCaprio and some admittedly visually striking scenes of the boat's sinking, the film (as any film is) is absolutely mortally impaired by Cameron's Jack and Jill simple script of poor but good boy loves rich but trapped in evil high society girl who are then tragically parted by cruel fate while their love is still young, sweet and fresh. If only genuine real life were actually like this perhaps films like this could be enjoyable, but any sensitive, perceptive mature adult knows that (perhaps unfortunately) that it just ain't so. Cameron is certainly, though, an extremely talented action director with the directing credits of Aliens and Terminator 2 to his name, he just shouldn't write his own scripts as in this department his insight and understanding of the depth and complexity of the genuine human experience is seriously lacking. I'll just keep rewatching Aliens and T2 and hoping that Cameron hires Frank Darabont (who wrote The Shawshank Redemption) to write his scripts, or stays firmly in the director's chair."

Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie. This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears. If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.

Titanic is very tough movie to watch and this film is directed by James Cameron.

The film is not new, but does not go out of fashion, does not leave indifferent even a person who is used to constantly hide emotions. Shown fear and love. It is instructive and even interesting to look at the behavior of people from the side, as if with the actors of the film you are experiencing what is happening in the film. Sometimes it seems that this is reality, but pincing yourself by the arm you understand that this is only a film. There is no pretense in the game of actors, it pleases me.

I really liked the film, I can't even say exactly what, just EVERYTHING with which it was made. Watching it, I feel myself there on the Titanic, after the film I immediately begin to have a value in life, I would never want to die like these people who were on board. I would even like to see the Titanic myself with my own eyes at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

The film has touched my soul so much that I don't think there is a film that will surpass the Titanic in its drama. This is my favorite movie from melodramas, and one of my favorite films in general. I really advice to watch this masterpiece."
2019-10-10,louisgreenland,"James Cameron has no idea how to write romance or even a good story around this topic. What was he thinking? Something so horrific like the Titanic disaster is ripe for modern story telling but James ""I made Avatar so that means im a good writer"" Cameron makes it about a boring, cliche ridden snooze fest. Even for 1997 it looks dated.

Awful overrated trash."

2019-09-20,blackwidowis7cool,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors. You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life. A strongly recommended movie."

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece."

2019-07-27,StonedMagician,"So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources."

2019-07-15,ronakkotian,"James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.

Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.

The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.

The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.

I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie."
2019-07-12,alphaomega-57581,"First of its kind to cross the magical one billion dollar frontier of admission splendour; to audiences around the world starting from mid-December 1997, when writer, producer, director James Cameron unleashes the ultimate sacrificing love story, portrayed by Academy-award winning actors Kate Winslet (The Reader 2008) and Leonardo DiCaprio (The Revenant 2015) on the infamous Liverpool cruiseliner ship ""Titanic"" sinking on April 12th 1912 into the Atlantic Ocean due to hitting a too-late foreseen iceberg as James Cameron holding all the strings over splendid cinematography with over lapping on-hand live-action footage in the first ever produced 200-Million-Dollar production, coming in with an approximately 1.6 billion U.S. dollar in worldwide box office revenue in spring 1998 after winning 11 Academy-awards at the 70th Oscars, except recognizing supporting acting bliss by Kathy Bates, Billy Zane and Bernard Hill as the legendary ship's captain."
2019-07-09,kaleidoscope_eyess,"While Cameron, the director, felt ""a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster,"" both the romance and the disaster failed. I loved the first part of the film, but my interest quickly lost after the second part began. The power of the first part of the film lies in its exploration of social class -- my heart melted upon seeing how Jack attempts to behave like an upperclassman and how Rose enjoys Jack's company and his surrounding. I agree this kind of story sounds cliché and the encounter between Rose and Jack is unlikely, but this love story realizes the fairy tale that everyone of us deeply relates and dreams to become true. However, the second part of the film immediately feels fake, kitsch, superficial and classist. It is lengthy and even melodramatic. For one thing, the most dangerous moment happens probably where Cal goes after Rose and Jack. The film abstains from any realistic and profound depiction of deplorable living condition in light of a disaster. Focusing on Rose, her family and her love interests, the film stages other common people as mere backdrop of the love story of an aristocrat. In the end, it becomes evident that Rose would survive and live a happy life anyway, which promptly overshadows the very existence and sacrifice of Jack."
2019-07-08,edwarddfrankenstein,"There are few films that elicit in me such passionate loathing as this piece of utter rubbish. This is lacking in practically everything that ought to be in a movie. No aliens, no graphic scenes of cannibalism, no serial killers, monsters spawned by nuclear power, special effects obviously made from random objects found in the director's office, or surrealistic body horror. Also, no werewolves. I suppose the title should have given me a warning, it doesn't contain the phrases ""blood"", ""invasion of the"", ""cannibal"", ""walks among us"", ""massacre"", "" meets Frankenstein"", or ""from outer space""; all of which are generally good indicators of quality cinema. It's also filmed in this weird artificial style, which I hate. Mainstream cinema fans might like this style, I prefer my films to look like they were made in someone's garage back in the 70s. And then there's that awful theme song. If you want a good movie theme song, listen to Surfing Dead by The Cramps, the theme from Return Of The Living Dead; by one of the finest bands in history. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, it essentially summarizes why I only watch B-movies. You could probably make 100 B-movies with this budget, and all of them would be more interesting. Just watch The Astro-zombies instead; now that's a good movie. Cameron has sunk far from his days doing special effects on Galaxy Of Terror (his best work by far. Who could forget the infamous worm scene?). Also, does anyone else think that Decaprio looks like a giant hairless squirrel?"
2019-07-07,AhmedSpielberg99,"The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn't lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron's Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare's masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and Céline Dion's My Heart Will Go On is timeless!

(8.5/10)"
2019-07-07,Aoi_kdr,"I remember that the nude scene kept me uncomfortable because I watched it with my father then.

I feel sad every time I watch the rise and fall of luxury cruise ship. I was impressed with a captain and band left on the shinking ship. They accepted to be with the ship quietly. I was so afraid of the scene people came off from the careening ship. It traumatized me because I have acrophobia. If I watched it in 3D, it would be more scary."

2019-06-27,dockerykelli,Titanic was such a wonderful movie!!! It accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with. The storyline behind it all including the CAST!!! A+++ Film
2019-06-27,ops-52535,"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.

when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.

its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..

the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list"
2019-06-27,Keemshave,"How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn't hold this film back from greatness. It's the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron's production is far ahead of it's time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It's such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime."

2019-06-06,HotToastyRag,"I have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic Titanic that swept eleven Academy Awards, but for the purposes of this review, I'll remain as impartial as possible. It won't do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobia.

From an artistic standpoint, this movie is flawless. The research and replication of the ill-fated RMS Titanic resulted in an identical duplication. Peter Lamont's production design, Michael Ford's set decoration, and Martin Laing and Charles Lee's art direction is breathtaking. If you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes, wallpaper, and chandeliers, you'll feel like you're really aboard the ship. The beautiful fashions, designed by Deborah Lynn Scott, are authentic looking and gorgeous. Most of the movie is very beautiful to watch, including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginning.

This wasn't the first movie about the Titanic, and this version's storyline isn't very interesting. Kate Winslet stars as a high-class lady travelling with her mother, Frances Fisher, and her fiancé, Billy Zane. She meets a low-class American, Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his passage in a card game, and he shows her how to really live and fall in love. Parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a Disney movie rather than a dramatic epic, but I'm sure the love story will please young-minded teenagers.

The beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, and a very old woman, Gloria Stuart, tells her memory of the voyage. There are a few cuts back and forth from Gloria's story to the 1912 timeline, but once the iceberg is hit, the rest of the film is shown in real-time, which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director James Cameron and his co-editors Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris. However, during the last portion of the film, there are a few flaws that aren't hard to catch, the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater. The literally freezing water doesn't make anyone's teeth chatter until they're submerged, but if enclosed in iceberg-infested waters up to one's thighs, symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen. In a romantic gesture, Kate Winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats, but she wouldn't have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mix.

So, depending on your point of view, you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor, full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song. You can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws, which you'll find. I won't ever watch the movie again, but let me know what you think!

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there are scary situations that scarred me for life, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

2019-05-14,federicaandretta,This movie reminds me of my teenage times. I was 14 years old when I went to the cinema with my family and some friends the first time. I would have never imagined that one day this film would become one of the greatest masterpieces in the world and that it would have an emotional impact on me. I love Titanic not only for the movie itself but also for the history that lies in it. James Cameron is not just a movie maker but a great poet who talks through his heart to us. He also tells a story in a way never done before. It's not just a love story or a history movie. It's more. It's hard to explain it in words but if one reads the books about the movie one can understand what I mean. I will always thank him for his work. His expeditions made to the relict also impressed me much. But I also want to thank his crew and all the people who worked with him! Also a special thank to all the actors obviously! Titanic was and will always be the ship of dreams to all of us.
2019-05-14,dostuaricardo,"Extraordinary love story and very touching heart. it's one of the best films I've ever watched. I don't know how to explain my feelings. oh god, this film makes me shed tears. even now when I watch this film again, it can't be felt not to shed tears. it is rare for me to feel this kind of feeling that is even difficult to express. I have never been bored to watch it repeatedly and even the power of the film hasn't diminished in the slightest, even though this movie has been released for quite a long time. maybe there are only a few films in this world that make the audience take part in feeling the story in this film.

When I first watched this movie, I cried and didn't know what to say, I thought it was an amazing film with a storyline that couldn't be guessed and there were not only sad parts but also parts that could make laughter so that this film not flat and not boring. Until now it was the best film in my life, no single film could match it. This film for me there are many grooves so we have to really pay attention from the beginning so that no part is missed so we will feel the intention to convey this film. I think this film has been very perfectly made with technological sophistication which at that time was very extraordinary. I think this character by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is extraordinary, they are like being able to be interconnected and truly like love stories in the real world. young couples who face complicated love stories in the middle of a different background, full of struggles and challenges that must be faced but with the power of love all can be passed.

I think this will be the best film of all time that will never be forgotten."

2019-04-27,angelos1974,"This movie sucks like a $2.00 lady of the night who has been given $20.00 and told to keep the change. Only a vacuum cleaner that's been left running for 24 hours straight sucks more than this movie. It's the suckiest movie that ever sucked. I've seen grade school plays that were better than this movie, honest to God, PLAYS!

What has warranted such dislike from me? Two words, forced viewing. I was forced to watch this drivel by my wife, and not only that, I payed my hard earned cash to waste my life watching a poorly-acted 'love-tragedy' that seemed to go on and on. I actually felt envious of the characters that died in the movie, as, essentially, their suffering was over. Never have I seen another movie that was filmed in such a manner that would please the 'luvvies' so much, so they'd just throw Oscars at it. But what about the cash-paying viewers?! Sure, the special effects are impressive, but that alone does not a good movie make, a good story that's interesting would be greatly appreciated, but instead we get Lenny D' Crapio, as eye candy for the ladies, the obvious target audience, and the poor men who've been dragged to the theatre get no love at all.

In conclusion, this movie would be playing on repeat for eternity in my version of Hell. I wish I could give it minus 1000,000 stars."
2019-04-16,gpeevers,"Neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believe.

The love story is good and the special effects are good, but considering the material Cameron was working with he didn't really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot less.

This is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have."

2019-04-14,lynlis,"I remember the first time I ever heard about the Titanic. I was 11 or 12 and my paternal grand mother told me. After watching this version with Leonardo and Kate I wasn't disappointed. They were fantastic in the 'Romeo/Juliet', star-crossed lovers type. There's been several comments regarding the scene towards the end where Kate (Rose) is seen on a wardrobe (with room for Leonardo) (Jack) to be saved with her. I guess the script didn't call for Titanic Pt 2 because, had it, no doubt Jack too would've survived. Billy Zane didn't disappoint as the villain. I didn't cry but I was moved by the reality of the sinking. It must've been truly horrific knowing there was so many who perished in this sinking. I have since found whenever I see a photo of the Titanic, I can actually hear the screams of despair. I saw 'Raise The Titanic', no way is it comparable to this movie. Raise The Titanic had many people believe she sunk intact, when, in fact, she was literally torn apart and crumbled as she sank. Titanic would have to be the most true-to-life, scary (not horror) but scary movie ever made."

2019-03-17,randydandykkkbb,Such a masterful film with great performances by winslet and di caprio. He definitely deserved an Oscar for this one. A film based on a real life tragedy
2019-03-15,pauldaguirre,"The most egregious aspect of this overblown cinematic vessel is not the cloying Dick and Jane script, the vulgar modern-day prologue, the primitive CGI effects (painfully obvious on the big screen even in 1997), the fact that DiCaprio looks like a thirteen year old who hasn't yet reached puberty, or the unfathomable eleven Oscars it snared.

No. The true crime here is that the perfect movie about the sinking of the Titanic had been fashioned four decades earlier in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which managed to break your heart with the genuine passenger list in its genuine predicament. The tragedy of the sinking, and the core of the 1958 film, is the arrogance of the masters of industry who propelled the Industrial Revolution. This was history. There was no need for a fictional plot, no blue diamond, no Celine Dion, no cartoon villains with twirling mustaches, no Frances Fisher spinning the same holier-than-thou act she's still doing on the Hallmark Channel, and no $250 million budget.

Watch A NIGHT TO REMEMBER. Then curse James Cameron for rightly assuming that modern-day audiences have no memory of their own cinematic heritage."
2019-03-13,krishdaggins,This film goes down in history as one of the best based on a true historical event. You'll feel the pain of the characters as the ship sinks. It's truly a human tragedy
2019-03-13,buehnec,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.

It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.

The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.

I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it. So if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry, or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose, then I highly recommend watching the Titanic."

2019-03-08,popcorn-reviews,"Titanic is really one of those movies that has something for everyone. Romance, action/disaster, the historical aspect, etc. This movie offers a little something to everyone.

2019-03-01,b-20302,"Titanic is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I still remember the first time I saw it back in junior high school days. Starting on a single ship, it is a story of love beyond the difference in economic position. In the first half of the movie, you can enjoy a pure love story.However, in the second half, it changes to a panic story with life and death. The sinking of the ship has shortened the distance between the two main characters.The scene where a person falls from a ship is miserable and can not be forgotten."
2019-02-26,Amanececonlos4,Titanic: Is a film that truly gets to your heart. Leonardo Di Caprio performance in this movie set him in the Hollywood radar despite not giving him an Oscar.

James Cameron went above and beyond illuminating this tragedy of the 1940s, paralleling the pain, heartbreak, romance, and anger from the horrific event directly through the film. The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later. The gut wrenchingly beautiful score by James Horner is one of the film's crucial elements, displaying a whole new realm of emotions with every note.

2019-02-10,ytpakkys,"It's been a long time since I last watched Titanic. I remembered some questionable dialogues and scenes from the last time I watched but what I had missed was something I had forgotten. The true essence of Titanic. The unending love for the story told in a way it was told. For another eight years, I was ignorant to it. I recently saw a clip of Titanic which got me pumped to watch it again. I started watching with my brother who never liked Titanic for reasons I couldn't understand. This time, not only did I remember what I missed, I felt the love with which it was made. Such magnificence. The story, style, chemistry of the actors and the characters being played, direction, score. Everything blended together to show why Titanic was ever popular! By the end of it, I was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it. And I finally witnessed what I was missing... Titanic. The way the story is told to eventually end on a note which would bring anyone to tears. It's perfection and to describe my experience in words in really difficult. I was enchanted, happy, sad and whatnot! This is a timeless masterpiece and will continue to be for all times to come."
2019-02-09,shielamaetapao,"I watched this movie and I fell inlove with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Jane Winslet) with their outstanding act. It's the most heartbreaking movie I have ever watched my entire life and until now I can't move on.

It's like watching a love story and turns into tragedy. Imagine that? How hurtful it is if you were at the Titanic and seeing your love dies. It is so painful but still worth to watch especially if you like sad endings. This is what you've been looking for!!!"
2019-02-08,CubsandCulture,"I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone. If you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama, i.e. woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety. If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. the band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let's you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them. I don't think anyone will like this film but I can't imagine how somehow would utterly hate it.

For my money I rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is. Both because it is fun to be snarky about Jack and Rose. (JACK! ROSE!). But more often than not I rather get swept up in the melodrama. I utter aware of the writing issues and yet I still feel melancholy at the end of the film.

On my last re-watch I was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time. There are shots/effects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way. Cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all work.

Yes this is a middle brow film. But just go with it."

2019-02-03,Lux55,"Titanic falls in the Epic Category along with movies such as ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""BEN Hur, to name a few. Period costumes, set design, believable characters incorporated to share a story of what could have happened on that fateful night. We just wanted to watch it again since it had been awhile."
2019-01-28,connykelber,"Of course I know the ending of ""Titanic"". Everybody knows the ending. Then why, oh why did this movie glue me to my seat for 3 hours - in the year 2018? It's absolutely thrilling! My rewatch was a complete surprise: Fantastic action, great directing, even the visuals didn't age as ugly as they could have. And the acting performances! I remember everyone being very sceptic about Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet back in the Nineties. But why? I don't get it. Also: What a joy to see Bernard Hill again, since I had a LotR-rewatch soon before. Noone can look as doomed as he can, be it in the battle of Helm's Deep or on the sinking Titanic.

But maybe it's the time that's changed. They don't make movies like that anymore, because they can't. If they try, something like ""Avatar"" comes out: Something predictable. A cliché. Maybe the time of the great Hollywood blockbuster is just over. Thank God we can always rewatch Titanic."
2019-01-28,archer191273,This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage. Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.

2019-01-16,DylanMcChillin,Only the emotionally immature will find this story romantic. It also doesn't age well. The CGI is absolutely terrible compared to today's standards. It was painfully obvious which scenes used a green screen. The acting is very wooden (there's a reason Leo's only won one Oscar in his entire career.)
2019-01-13,rajawizakaria-69408,"Titanic is one of the best films that attracted my attention. It was produced by James Cameron in 18 november 1997 in Londres. It is a romantic film. Titanic is one of the most expensive movies ever made. It has grossed over 1 billion world wide at the boxe office, making it one of the highest grossing films of all time. It received 14 Academy Award nominations and won 11 of them, including Best Picture of 1997 and Best Song for Celine Dion perfoming ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"". The movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic with Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet as the main actors. During 197 minutes, Titanic tell the story of a young poor guy Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) who travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with a big dream, on board he meets a fabulous wealthy girl Rose (Kate Winslet). He fells in love with her as soon he sees this gorgeous girl. However, after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold. The Titanic starts sinking. To sump it up, I really find that this movie shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. Moreover, the story of the film is very amazing and also the performance of both actor Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet was so brilliant. I personally recommended to see this film because it's a beautiful movie."

2018-12-31,kva77,There is not one movie James Cameron makes that is not worth watching ... He is the second most perfectionist director that ever lived. Nobody will probably ever beat the undisputable number one.. Stanley Kubrik
2018-12-30,snagssharkteeth-23785,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.

Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.

That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.

Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice. It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor. That was the division and a sad one at that. Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that. Which is acceptable.

Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry. Its extremely well filmed. The filmography is brilliant, the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each second.

There was a dispensation in film making of peak performances, this era seemed to last less than twenty years, this film was filmed during it,"

2018-12-03,arjunflamingfeather,"TITANIC LEO and KATE or WINSLET are wearing each other in their friendship. It is two decades but still, romantic. The movie with LEO prior to winning his OSCAR for BEST ACTOR is the unlike event of it happening to us. We are not sailors but we need them and they need us to be present. Sailing on a boat or a ship like in ""LIFE IN THE MISSISSIPI"" is a waste of valued coal but the steam engine that crossed those days disappeared as well."

Its most indulgent moments have become the stuff of parody. But if we're going to judge this film, let's judge it by its impact on release. I saw it seven times before it left the theater. I was entranced by it. The performances were stunning, as was the cinematography and direction. It's a great story, about the folly of human beings and the absolute imperative of living your life while you've got breath in your lungs. I loved the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, but there were great performances as well from Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart. I loved the use of music. I loved the whole thing. After you watch a film 900 times, you lose sight of what was great about it and all that remains is its imperfections. This was still a great ride."
2018-11-23,ups-36964,"Titanic is one of my favourite. Definitely not because of Jack and Rose's boring romance and blah blah blah.But due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made. It could be even better if the romance sequences were cut short.

2018-11-08,gul_hameed,"Ok let's be honest. I'm 17, and this movie is about 21 years Old. I've seen Hundreds of Hollywood Movies including Fictional, Romantic, Tragedies, Drama and Action. But this Movie is included in all the above Categories. And in all of that it has been ""The Number 1 Top grossing Blockbuster movie"" for over 12 years. The Director Mr. James Cameron has done brilliant Job in working on such a great Project. The Movie seems to look alive even after 21 years. The Effects used in the Movie are Outstanding even for the present day. Actually, the reason why I wanted to give a review about this movie was that I loved the Fictional part of this Movie i.e. Jake and Rose. Cameron Has done a great Work in writting such a Wonderful And Fascinating Love story ever written. I've seen alot of Dramatic scene but, this Movie actually brought tears in My eyes. This Fictional Part of the Movie looks so real and Every scene that Includes Jake and Rose in it just trembles my Heart. The Theme song of this Movie ""My heart will go on"" just refreshes the soul and Gradually brings tears as we go on to listen it reminding about Jake and Rose. The Best scene was When Rose Survives and Reaches America, She looks at the Statute of Liberty city missing Jake. And a few moments later an officer asks Her name and she answers: ""Rose Dawson"" naming after Jake. I think I'm gonna need a physiatrist hehehe because I've been Watching this movie 6 times consecutively. I just love this Movie so much. Leo and Kate are my Favourite Hollywood celebrities of All time. This Movie is never dying Master piece. Love You Jake and Rose <3. (Excuse My English Please)"

Maybe because human being is learned that love is the best and true love is in stories and rare. and what is rare so is much more interesting for people. To me, it was beautiful to see a person could decide for herself. She could be different than all her families, could enjoy simple things. The whole story is memorable, lovely, and classic!"

It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!"
2018-09-27,lorcan-61881,"If you have not seen Titanic, I'm sure you've heard of it, and of so, please do watch it because not only is the film a ""great watch"" or a great ""thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes"", but Titanic is one of the greatest films of all time. The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I've ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion's fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen!

Our memories construct the great history. And Titanic is about an old woman's memory about a huge famous boat and her lover she met during her endless trip to America. The first time I watched this film was in my early age. And some precious memory of my own happened during that time. Maybe this is the most important part of the movie to myself."

The freeing nature of the two characters and breaking from their social classes to be together is very Romeo and Juliet, but the intense romance between them is something to be seen. That love alongside the unusual combination of a disaster paints a strangely beautiful picture of love."

2018-08-01,albertsmith-32785,"Titanic was a massive success upon release and still continues to be immensely popular. It is easy to see why: Jim Cameron is a master filmmaker and the set for the film- the ship itself is so awe inspiring you'd be fooled into thinking this was the real ship. The film is incredibly well paced- despite being quite long and the casting is top notch. Titanic made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio and they are quite good here. One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic. Its funny to think that Titanic's box office record was eventually broken by his own Avatar, which is a testament to his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker."
2018-07-28,notaseriousgirloriginal,"It was the first romance I ever saw in movies ,I was 11 and cried for such a tragic ending it has .9 years later ,I lost the count of how many times I saw the movie .You can watch it in any mood .Believe me ,it's not the characters or plot but the whole setting of something bad we knew will happen is the thing ,that creates the emo connection and there is no other movie that compares ,Titanics glamourous presentation."
2018-07-20,perica-43151,"This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature."
2018-07-18,DylanMcChillin,The movie is so historically inaccurate that it should be considered a satire. It's extremely disappointing and the acting is subpar. Hopefully they'll do a remake of an actual story that occurred on the Titanic.
2018-07-13,TheNabOwnzz,"It is quite easy to be swept away by Titanic's outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score, and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked. As an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointment.

As stated before the cinematography in Titanic is fantastic, with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles. A couple of scenes such as the attempted Rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though, but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful. The indoor set design is also amazing, and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design. The musical score by James Horner is also ( as to be expected from him ) a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in Titanic. However, while it is a very stylish film this way, it doesn't manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema, such as its acting or its screenplay, which are both very inconsistent to say the least. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates & Bernard Hill are some examples of actors/actress who do show a impressive performance, but Kate Winslet as young Rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time, and i find it hard to see what Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sees in her because of this. Winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this, since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural. While DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he seems to be struggling in every scene in Titanic, primarily because he is simply miscast. He is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance, and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond. ( For an actually GOOD young DiCaprio role, watch the Basketball Diaries (1995) )

Unfortunately James Cameron not only wanted to direct, but also write a film as grand in scale as this one. This results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with. Titanic offers little sub text, symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least. There are a lot of corny moments and cliché dialogue ( The entire scene of Rose discovering Jack's talent for drawings for example ) and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it, which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audience's intelligence, and it results in Titanic being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumb.

The first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film, as Cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable & arrogant folk the rich people are, and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be. This might not have been so bad, if Cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter, but this was not the case, as for example Billy Zane's character Cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad. Ofcourse no offense to Billy Zane, who was great as his character, but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film, and this never changes. We get it Cameron, the rich guy is the bad guy, no need to shove it down our throats. Cameron's greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writer.

The second half of the film is more of a disaster movie, and it isn't so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster, except the monster in this film is the water. Even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of Titanic, the second half contains no depth whatsoever, and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about. In the end we don't really care that much about Rose and Jack either, since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by Cameron was not fantastic either. It also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice, with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape. While this might be realistic in a film about the Japanese bushido code, in Titanic it feels out of character and it just doesn't fit, since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their lives.

Cameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy, ( The opening scene with the old footage of Titanic actually setting off with Horner's score is ofcourse fantastic ) but in substance Titanic is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had."
2018-07-10,huiyingdotc,I can still remember the first time I watched this and the music of the beginning of movie kept sticking on my head over and over again.
2018-07-09,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,"Adventurers delve to the bottom of the ocean to search the ghostly remains of the Titanic. It's a very haunting moment because it still rests at the bottom of the ocean this day. They find a safe with a drawing of a young woman wearing a ruby known as 'The Heart of the Ocean'. They get a call from a 100 year old lady claiming the drawing is her.

There is great chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio who both give great performances. It's a groundbreaking achievement from the gorgeous cinematography, sound effects and editing. It's a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs, costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look. James Horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense.

James Cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action sci-fi blockbusters like the Terminator films and The Abyss. He proves that he is very versatile filmmaker who can make more than just action films. Its no surprise the film won 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film ever made."
2018-07-07,yankeefan-83157,I love titanic it one of the greatest movie of all time
2018-07-06,shawnparsons-62766,Titanic is world famous. The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order. The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.

2018-07-03,paulclaassen,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).

It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.

Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!"

2018-06-29,habib_khodadad,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings."

2018-04-12,elsahouse,"Haters clearly don't understand how emotion is part of the humanity and Titanic is full of emotional element and therefore, a true humanity in cinematic world. If a movie make so many people left the theater in tears, clearly haters lost their heart and intelligence

Haters clearly don't understand, how Titanic mixed the spectacle visual experience and top-class technology filmmaking process with emotional element and sense of melancholy. The movie proved that visual sensation and emotional experience are not mutually exclusive.

Eyes and Heart are synced, but hater's brain aren't synced with blood,"
2018-04-12,rk_house,"Poor dialogue, one-dimensional character, predictable plot, Titanic looked weak in its screenplay. Thanks to James Cameron, Titanic deliver the most stunning achievement of blending the art with visual sensation!

""You jump I jump"", ""Make each day counts"", ""Jake!""""Rose!"", The cheesy dialogue somehow, were wonderfully delivered by its two leading actor and actress -Leonardo and Kate. They turned the awful dialogue into one of the most iconic line. Their chemistry in the movie is flawless despite the shortcomings of story. The passionate performance by this pair of star, make the entire romantic plot convincing and memorable. Both stars are just perfect for being an iconic couple. The way they brought themselves into the character was so engaging for audience and make us emotionally invested into them and their romance.

When Cameron decided to use full scale of model of titanic for sinking sequence, it's already half way to its visual success. The sinking sequence was one of the most thrilling experience in cinematic history. You're not watching the sinking, Cameron takes you there! The fall of funnel, dome implosion, people sliding off the floor, splitting of titanic...all are meticulously crafted and edited in such a way that you are almost think that that is the actual real-time disaster. It's nearly impossible to execute the idea of making the sinking be so real and the sinking carried no notable plot, all they need to do is to make the sequence of terrifying and they did it! The intensity of the sinking, amplifying the epic love of Jake and Rose. The sinking played as an ultimate villain for their romance.

The romance of Jack and Rose is magical surreal while the sinking of titanic is realistically represented. Both visual style and tone signifying the tension of plot, and they crafted in complementary style.

And last, the death of Jack is the ultimate representation of the lost of 1500 souls on that ship. It was the Loss moment that whatever kind of disaster should ended with - The loss of loved ones. Through the tragic end of Jack, the modern time scene highlight that, it is the moment of melancholy. When the old rose , played by Staurt, emotionally told the story, nothing could go more melancholic. Titanic, proved that the sadness and melancholy are a perfect match of epic. That ending, remind all of us, what we lost in the past, will become a source of melancholy in future.

Music and scores was the main driver for emotional feeling. James Horner masterpiece style of scores and song, ""My Heart will Go on"", sang by Celine. The lyrics and scores are so effective to the point that the music help you the understand the implicit detail of their romance and brought into the character inner world. The song has run for 2 decades and more will come. It's so trangenerational appealing.

Titanic suffered huge backlash especially among fan boys after its unprecedented success. The backlash is understandable but stupid. For boys, they love to dismiss romance, just like how oscar dismiss superhero genre. The greatness of Titanic shall be upheld. It;s an classic example of successful and deluxe style of filmmaking. For those who claim the story is weak, kindly read storybook or novel. Titanic is a film in which visual comprised its load of greatness. Titanic provided one of the kind experience that too rare to be seen in theater, and unexpectedly, it was built upon a very weak screenplay/story."

2018-02-03,anzlkd,"Titanic is an enjoyable film, which can make you cry. It is based on a real story about a liner which got into difficulties in the ocean. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

The film begins with a boy Jack, who won a ticket for a cruise where he meets a wonderful women called Rose and immediately falls in love with her. She also understands that she loves him, but they can't be together because she has a fiance. The film reaches a turning point when an impatient man asks the captain of the ship to go faster.

I think that the best thing about ""Titanic"" is the love story and Leonardo DiCaprio of course. This film doesn't have any bad things. For me the film is the best of the best.

Overall, I would recommended watching ""Titanic"" at least once in a lifetime for everyone. If you love drama, then this is for you."
2018-02-02,belloumal,"This movie is a romance and a tragedy. The main actors are Kate Winslet (she plays Rose), and Leonardo DiCaprio (he plays Jack). Rose is a rich lady, she has a lot of money. Jack, the second character, is a poor person, he doesn't have money. The story starts when they go on a big boat going to America, called the Titanic. On the boat, they meet and fall in love, and have a romance. Their love transforms in passion, but the Titanic as strong as we think ?

I love Titanic, because this movie is a true love story who doesn't agree with the social walls. I like it too because Leonardo is very nice and beautiful, like Kate Winslet. I'm a fan of these actors, their actor play is perfect."

2018-01-02,samourx,"Exploitation is the apporopriate description.Taking the worst tropes of exploitation cinema, a genre which has a lot of merits, James Cameron bolted on a sub standard Mills and Boon romance and made it the central story. There are good performances, just not by the leads. Kate Winslett is wooden, which is supposed to represent uptight. Dialogue is anachronistic for the period suited for 1997 and not 1912. With the lavish budget and long production time Titanic could have been an excellent study of class, society and prejudice. All of that is lost in favor of presenting a teenage love story. The last scene was also egregious. A Night To Remember is a superior film."
2017-12-29,frederik_falk,"Never have i EVER been fascinated by a movie like Titanic did. The story of a dream sinking on her maiden voyage, killing 1500 people, and affecting the lives of several thousands. This catastrophy would shake a whole world. James Cameron made Titanic remembered on a whole new level. James Cameron reached for the stars. And he got 'em.

This movie changed the movie industry (IMHO) for ever. The amount of ressources and time spend on reproducing this vessel, is astonishing. And even 20 years after, I have no complaints to the special effects (or the plot for that matter).

The plot is somehow a bit of a cliché. Jack, a handsome third class passenger, falling in love with the stunning first class passenger Rose. And their struggle together to leave the doomed ship. Normally i would never go for a love movie, as Titanic. But James Cameron built it really well, especially because of the ending.

The music composed for this movie has become legendary, and builds the emotions that define the whole impression of the movie. James Horner did a remarkable job to achieve this.

I have in my 22 years, never seen a movie like Titanic. I have watched it +20 times, and I will watch many times again. The ending never fails to wet my eyes.

I can only recommend this movie everyone. Watch it, and cry yourself to sleep!"

ADVENTURE, LOVE, EMOTION, HISTORY are just a few words that can synthesize exceptional cinematic transposition of a real event that has forever marked the history of the xx century. Although I watched the movie more than 10 times, every time I was enchanted for the first time. Is one of the most loved stories, and since the time when I look at it I leave a conclusion that is, the moment must be lived, just like the two lovers who live your love story in front of all the obstacles I encounter all without regrets. They also feel the intensity of life and slowly build their own world on a wonderful boat which eventually this carefree world of those missed lovers would turn into a painful reality, a real disaster.

From my point of view, this film is a masterpiece of all supremacy: director, script, protagonists, memorable scenes, and every review could only confirm my theory that TIME is the most hopeful friend and simultaneous enemy of mankind, but LOVE is the only feeling that can overcome barriers of any kind, especially in limit situations.

In conclusion, the film is appreciated by millions of people.Is a 10-foot movie, I recommend you watch him review you whenever you are in a difficult situation even if you do not find solutions to problems, at least you will disconnect from self-destruction"
2017-10-24,saletehnolog,"Titanic is one of the best movies I've been watching. Di Caprio and Kate are magnificent, producing and directing fascinating. The shiny scenes from the moment of impact in the ice floe to total submersion take away breath. When I remember those scenes when Kate takes the ax and enters the water to the head to reach the room where Leonardo is bound, an angry pass me. The complete set is enchanting. This is a movie that fully justified the funds invested and who for the reason earned a lot more money. Although the film was made in the late nineties, I can say that he is a classic for all time. Jamie Cameron set standards for the future with this film."

2017-09-24,MuviFan73,"The movie puts light on the romance that Jack and Rose shared. Although Jack died that night but the love he placed in her heart will not die till she is alive. Titanic is among the first Hollywood movies that I got to see on television. I like this movie from the day I first saw it. It is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as well.

Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets, water bodies and their working. Well I would say they all got well along (4/5).

Tone: Movie takes us on a ride where two people fall in love but one dies as titanic sinks. It is how Rose has those emotions still with her and would go away only with her death. As they call now grown old Rose to explore sank titanic to find lost jewel. The jewel is although with Rose and the secret that what she does of it will die with her. I would say it as epic romantic tone. (5/5).

Music: The movie puts light on how the musicians on board were still performing as titanic was sinking. It captures your heart (3.5/5).

Acting: Acting is good (3.5/5).

Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)]."
2017-09-08,Mr-Fusion,"Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.

This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it's actually about White Star Line's monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director's name.

But the rest of it . . .

2017-06-20,stormhawk2020,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here."

Tragedy struck,1503 people died leaving the whole world shell- shocked. Good story for a movie,right? So James Cameron decided to do it.Years of obsession,research,plotting and 200 million USD went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time. The result? Titanic became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all time,only 2nd to james cameron's own avatar. What makes the film so special? Its the way it unfolds,the way it is engineered by cameron. The writing,special effects are beyond brilliant,the fictional part of the film has become iconic,everything clicks. When the movie starts,during 1st few seconds,the background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be special,it goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hours,we are told the great story of the titanic. We get to experience the splendour of the ship,know the perspective of ALL the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins. Cameron lets us to see the things from every character's perspective,be it jack,fabrizio,rose,her mother,her fiancé,her fiance's right hand,the captain,the passengers,EVERYONE. We see how they see things and it is amazing. The tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible way.The thrill,the tension,the fascination,the grandeur,the love,the tragedy,in these 200 minutes,we experience it all. Kudos to Cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come. From a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical story,here's a piece of advise- watch this film now if u haven't. It will stay with u for a very,very long time. U don't watch titanic,u experience titanic. The best of the best!"

2017-05-12,Kingslaay,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless."
2017-04-13,dandare4479,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired.

I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d."
2017-03-28,foxhound-37781,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.

It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.

Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.

Anyway, onto the movie...

A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.

Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fiancé, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.

The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fiancé cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old. Phenomenal film. 10 out of 10. Fox."
2017-03-25,ekaplan-44469,"I had a crush on this boy and we were sorta friends. I have tried too convince myself out of the crush but was not successful. Then I saw this movie, I saw how much he loved her so I thought I want someone like that forget him. I basically cried the last hour that movie touched me in places I didn't know I had.

2017-03-14,jhnachos,"Titanic is one of the highest grossing movies ever made and the film won 11 Oscars. Many considered it one of the best films in history, I have no idea why. Titanic is in no way a bad movie. The scale of destruction of the title ship is gorgeous and the cinematographer is fantastic. Yet nothing else about the movie is all the great in my opinion. The acting is not bad, they just don't stand out. The dialogue was most cheesy and not all that powerful. None of the performances keep me that invested which is bad considered the two and half hours that Titanic milks its romance. The film feels like its five hours long and I constantly looked at the time to see when it was over. Personally I don't think romances are the type of movies that need to be three hours long, but that's just my opinion. Overall the last 30 minutes or so of titanic are fantastic, but it takes a while to get there with nothing really keeping you invested. If you like romance movies you will most likely love this movie, but as for me it felt a drag of a romance that didn't need to be that long."

2017-02-25,zkonedog,"For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, ""Titanic"" was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, ""Titanic"" still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by ""Avatar"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""). However, along the way ""Titanic"" gained a bit of a reputation as a ""chick flick"", what with ""dreamy Leo"" and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet's character. Fortunately, what I've learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.

For a basic plot summary, ""Titanic"" tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the ""upper crust"" first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.

The main reason I can appreciate ""Titanic"" is because I like films that really ""go for it"", so to speak. ""Titanic"" is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today's standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in ""Titanic"" (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).

Cameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the ""unsinkable ship"" sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I'm sure that (knowing Cameron's style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.

The only reason I can't give ""Titanic"" the full five stars? Well, there's two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the ""class differences"" stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the ""first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes"" trope. I know from ""Avatar"" that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that's just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the ""moon-eyed lover"" of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.

I think that ""Titanic"" is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film ""Dead Poet's Society"". Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is ""old hat"", there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to ""Titanic"", too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, ""Titanic"" is truly a treasure."
2017-02-07,snperera,"Wow, well what can I say that hasn't already been said. these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story!! How amazing! Leo and Kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet. In the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship. The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It's still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn't imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite! Leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and Kate is as well."
2017-01-21,tjeffsmith,"I saw Titanic 4 times when it came out ... Still in theaters. I've never done that. Not before or since. It is not just the story of the sinking or the loss of life. I mean...there's that story, well-told. But the love story of Jack and Rose told against the backdrop of an epic disaster is so poignant. It was a phenomenon...the movie was. I watched it again tonight ... 20 years later, and it holds up even now. Titanic is James Cameron's Mona Lisa. His Free Bird. A masterpiece. Don't listen to the naysayers and haters commenting here on IMDb ...that it's overrated. If anything a film that garnered 11 academy awards rated a 7.7 on IMDb is grossly UNDERrated. It's a beautiful film still."
2016-12-22,beresfordjd,"While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation."

2016-12-14,ellisonatlanta,"Titanic is a film that caught my emotions the very first time I saw it. It is one of the most successful movies ever made, as well as one of the most beloved. The plot describes how two young people, Rose and Jack, meet each other abroad the Atlantic ocean and fall in love. The way that this movie portrays the tragedy is so beautiful and eye catching. It is filmed with such color that the audience is just drawn to it right away. The acting is another strong point of the film. It gives the audience almost an out-of-body experience as it takes you through the plot. It is as if we are living the events on the screen: in a sense they are happening to us. The title ""Titanic"" automatically gives off a tragic tone. Everybody knows what happened on the ship. However, the many different shifts in tone make this film that much more enjoyable. It connects to the audience's emotions in such a way that they see all the different perspectives of the movie."

It rumbles along at a steady pace with not much happening apart from some good effects and a boring love story. The story between the two lead actors feels awkward and false. It is a bit of a bore to be blunt but the special effects save it.

Typical Hollywood romantic dross.

This is not a film for men!

Be safe - stay away!!

2016-11-09,Derekrusselpurvis,"I remember seeing this movie a few times when I was only 7 years old, I didn't understand much of the romance; but I do remember the ship and all the water, and especially the ending. It's been almost 20 years since I last saw Titanic, and after seeing it for the first time as an adult; wow, what a ride. I'm not sure even with today's visual effects and so forth if a remake would be able to do any better in resenting the liner, and capture the feel that James Cameron did. I really enjoyed Titanic, and happy to give it a 9/10.

The dialogue in some places is a little unconvincing, along with some of the choices made ha-ha. Some things seemed ambit rushed, but with such a small time scale to work with, rushed in probably a unavoidable aspect. (Bar making Titanic a 4+ hour long film)

Very cleaver writing to make Titanic a love story upon such a tragic event, no doubt just a story about the event would have been ""tragically boring"" so I enjoyed having something to keep me distracted (Heros and villains) while the Titanic ... did its thing.

I recommend this film today and for the next 20+ years, and would be very interested if anyone would like to try and top it with a Titanic remake."
2016-11-08,jehanosama,"This movie is so well done. The quality is amazing and both actors did a super great job. What I like most about the movie is that the Rose and Jack were friends and lovers at the same time. The love theme in the movie is great and there are a lot of heart-touching moments that you have to see. This movie will make you capable of falling in love again and again! Nice romantic vibes. And Leo Dicaprio is gorgeous and Kate is beautiful as well. If you are so into romance, I am sure this will be one of the best romantic movies you'll ever see. Get ready for your heart to beat! Get ready to get goosebumps. Get ready for super chilly feelings. You're about to watch the great movie, Titanic. Enjooooy!"

2016-10-11,StuOz,"The famous story of the Titanic is told.

So much has been said about this movie, what can I add? I guess the first thing that springs to mind is the timeless appeal of the film. When I saw it a few times in 1997 there was question in my mind about the timeless element of the flick...would I still love it so much 20 (or 19) years later? Well guess what, I do.

In fact, in some ways I like it even more now. Since 1997 has there been a movie where the production crew have actually built large sections of a massive ship just for a movie? And what about the wonderful musical score! Do we get scores like that today?

Titanic is a movie everybody must see before they die as I don't think Hollywood will ever make a movie like this again."

2016-09-03,filipemanuelneto,"This film focuses on the tragic first voyage of the British luxury steamer RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic. Directed and written by James Cameron, the film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The soundtrack, one of the most iconic of cinema, is James Horner.

Titanic will always be the icon of the golden age of maritime passenger transport. The biggest of steamers, the most luxurious of luxury ships, it was the largest ship in the world at the time and it was said that it was unsinkable. Unfortunately, everything is made of iron can sink. The negligence of the responsible for the ship, which ignored all warnings of ice and never prepared it with enough lifeboats to all the people inside it, led to a huge and unnecessary tragedy.

In the midst of all, we have the unlikely love between Rose, a rich girl, and Jack, a young who grew up in the streets. It's the classic cliché ""rich girl loves poor boy"" or, in this case, ""adventurer, eager to make a fortune, loves rich and bored girl who wants to feel strong emotions"". Their story is similar to many others and, in addition to never be credible enough, it quickly becomes cloying and boringly predictable, and gives voice to the preconceived ideas of Cameron, showing social ""barriers"" rich/poor ( symbolized in the film by locked doors between the ship classes) as if they were divisions between good and bad. World is not so simple, so dark-and-gray, and divisions like that still exists today, in other ways.

The choice of the two main actors was excellent. Although still young and not well known, they have become stars. DiCaprio was the pretty face of the girl's wet dreams for a long time thanks to this movie, and even had to take off the heartthrob image later to diversify his career. In fact, he is a talented actor, as Kate, and both worked well in the romantic scenes. The film also contains stunning scenes of the ship, whose interiors have been carefully re- created and then destroyed during the scene of the wreck. The details are excellent, they were in the collective memory for the quality that was achieved. Special and sound effects are also excellent."

A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

I love the film very much. Every time I am moved to tears. I am filled with heartrending sorrow. However the heroine live strongly after the parson who she loves, so I am encouraged. The music of the film is also good. I love the song, My Heat Will Go on, sung by Celine Dion. The film contains love story element and panic element, so we never lost interest in the film.

Folks, the point of this movie is about the love story. It just happens to take place on the Titanic. Kind of to give you two tragedies! Like when older rose said ""there was a jack Dawson and he saved me in every way a person could be saved"" it's supposed to show the affection between them! Then later own jack says ""this was the best thing that happened to me winning the tickets to be on titanic, it led me to you"" (something like that) Cameron did a great job combining the two and making it feel like we were the third wheel or something lol Leo and Kate were amazing. They both did great. Of course Kate did better; it had more to do with her Life and how she wanted to escape but didn't know how to. I cry every single time I watch this movie. It's so upsetting. Not only with the titanic and everyone dying but with the love story as well. Rose and jack finally found someone who truly loves them and yet one had to die. I love this movie. It's romantic it's sad it's fun it's everything!!!"

It gives me the shivers every time I watch it. I love this film not for the love story but for the depiction of every passenger on board. You see the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaits ahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk. Cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to survive and the social differences very well.

Considering this is a 1997 film, it's still better than a lot of new films today, both story-wise and special effects wise."

2016-05-02,wittkecmission,"Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted. But that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece. Because there is nothing in the film that I would improve, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING."
2016-04-28,oOoBarracuda,"Rounding out a three-way tie for most Academy Award wins, James Cameron's 1997 Best Picture-winning film Titanic, was as massive in scope as the doomed titular White Star liner. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet join together to tell the story of the most well-known nautical disaster of the 20th century. Cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster, largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist. The story is told in sweeping Cameron fashion, that he is well known for, through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship.

Boarding the luxurious R.M.S. Titanic with her family and fiancé, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat. The beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with. Once the ship docks in Philadelphia, Rose is to marry Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with Cal, and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of Rose's father has brought to their family. While pondering her future plight along the ship deck, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her. Instantly smitten, Jack's new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with Rose. Jack finally gets his chance when he talks Rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out. Being invited to dinner with Cal and Rose's family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time, Jack borrows a suit and charms Rose. Knowing how she feels about her life and fiancé, Jack stops at nothing to convince Rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom Rose so desires. The story of the doomed love is told through 101-year old Rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton).

Taken at what it is, Titanic is a wonderful film. Cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ship's voyage. The film is heavy on romance, however, and if that's not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone. The film looks as beautiful as it sounds, which is no easy feat given the subject manner. The elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well. As good as Winslet was in the role, she seemed miscast for the part. Her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17-year-old young woman. The chemistry between the two actors, however, was magical, and may be the reason to overlook Winslet not being believable as a teenager. Class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film. Rose loves art, and Jack is an artist in the time where even Pablo Picasso's works are looked upon as infantile, with Cal proclaiming that he ""will never amount to a somebody"". In a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to, Jack and Rose can't find a place to fit in, which is only made better by them finding each other; and really, who can't relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live?"
2016-04-27,Kirpianuscus,"I do not like Titanic. too much ambition, too many applauds. but it has the rare gift to use romanticism to remind a story who becomes , grace of Cameron, mythical. it has, in same measure, the virtue to use Gloria Stuart in a beautiful, touching role. and to impose to public Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, both great actors. story of an impossible love story , in fact it is only the story of force of memories and the confrontation with the past's ghosts. it is story of a gem and story of a slice of happiness. and it is not fair to ignore the great care for details, the hard work of entire team, the craziness of Cameron to recreate a lost picture. but the ambition has always unfinished products. Titanic is a beautiful film. but not more. a blockbuster useful for tears and for a high position in statistics. but , maybe, it is enough because, I admit, I am deep subjective, Titanic has not the sparkle who transforms beautiful films in great films."
2016-04-18,grantss,"A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long.

Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.

On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio's case, shifted it up several notches)."
2016-04-11,EnglishPaper,"Titanic is an American epic,romantic and drama film. It's was written and produced by James Cameron in 1997 about a boat in 1912 to be more precise,Titanic was a British boat that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912 after hitting with an iceberg during the travel from Southampton to New-York City. This boat caused the death of more than 1506 people.The film is a global success and received 11 awards and elected Best film.The film tells the story of two passengers in love on the Titanic. Their love story began when Rose wanted to commit suicide but Jack, a poor vagrant dissuaded to do this. They lived love story but it became a nightmare because of tragic adventures. People don't understand why Rose left down Jack . They think Rose should have let Jack get on board the raft,they think she is selfish. But even if the film end is tragic ,it is better because it is more emotional.The true story is a sad story, no after possible so the logic want Titanic to be the first and last film with the same name.Thus end is horrible but another screenplay will be greatly less breathtaking.We love like that,this incredible and timeless film,Titanic that pushed all of us to cry."

2016-03-19,colm-hearne365,"Frankly I don't care what cynical people say about Titanic whether they say it's overrated or it's too long or it didn't deserve to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time or it didn't deserve to win 11 Oscars. I mean I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to say Titanic moved me to tears and is one of my favourite movies. There is a reason why it won Best Picture at the Oscars as well as many other rewards.

It takes the tragic story of Titanic and mixes with a classic love story as well as adventure and some horror and turns it into a film that is so beautiful to look at. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater make such a wonderful and beautiful couple and act their parts perfectly. The movie is also brilliantly directed by one of my favourite directors, James Cameron and this is up there with his other masterpieces like Avatar, Terminator 2 and Aliens. Not to mention the music matches well with the movie thanks to the work of James Horner's score especially with the love scenes.

But even a movie as sad and tragic has a happy ending. Like I know people didn't like how it ending or thought it was confusing but I mean it actually that old Rose died in her sleep and she's with everyone who died on the Titanic, including Jack of course. So in conclusion, if you've never seen Titanic and you like movies, prepare to have a new favourite movie."

2016-02-18,InaneSwine,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.

First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.

However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.

So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.

Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get."
2016-01-18,valene-01952,"The film ""Titanic"" is produced by James Cameron. It is starred by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane. The story is about a love story which takes place on the Titanic. This boat goes to America. The film begins with Rose and Jack who fall in love although there are from very different social classes. Rose is with her fiancé and her family who are very rich and Jack is very poor. What is surprised me it's the end because it's a very beautiful and sad story at the same time. I like this film because of the story and the main characters. This film is very interesting there is a love story and moreover there is the story of the Titanic which is a tragedy. Moreover, the B.O is very well."

2016-01-14,sandnair87,"The story of 'Titanic' is so good that if written as mere fiction, it would be dismissed as preposterous.

In April of 1912, Titanic set out on its maiden voyage to the City of New York. 'The Ship of Dreams' as it was called, was a floating palace for the wealthy elite, reportedly 'unsinkable' by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology. After winning a pair of third-class tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) looks forward to returning to his native America but finds himself drawn to a first-class passenger named Rose (Kate Winslet). She is the 16-year-old fiancée of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) - a high-society gentleman that doesn't like to lose - returning from her wedding in Europe; a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the family's faded coffers. After Jack's chance meeting on the ship's fantail with Rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean, an unlikely romance begins. No sooner do they profess their love to each other, than an iceberg in the North Atlantic tests the character of everyone on board, from the ship's captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe, stable deck out from beneath the characters.

Titanic is an extraordinary motion picture – a jaw-dropping feat of outstanding art direction, costume design and cinematography. The film captures the essence and decadence of the era, as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself. Coupled with nearly seamless visual effects, James Cameron's Titanic feels like a wholly real creation. Instead of treating the Titanic as a microcosm of society, Cameron makes the ship a vividly realized, fluid symbol of human destiny, mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character, from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room. Created through a complex blend of partial sets, models and digital effects, Cameron's Titanic is breathtaking in its wholeness, heartbreaking in its destruction. The film's final hour portrays the sinking, not merely as spectacle, but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die. But perhaps, the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way 'Titanic' sucks us into what seems, on the surface, to be a magnetic romance, while underneath, there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris. Yes, he does paint his story in broad strokes, and some of the dialogue is risible, but Leo and Kate sell the hell out of it, with their undeniable chemistry.

Titanic isn't just a great film, it's a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history, that is both poignant and personal."

Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece. I've seen it a dozen time and ugly cry every time."
2015-12-04,anthonystitanic,"Absolutely amazing film, great C.G.I, still up to date and highly believable. Brilliant accuracy proud to see how well so much hard work had payed off. The amount of work that went into making this film has heavily impacted the final product and that final product is amazing and a must watch. Additional scenes are also well done, the whole thing is well scripted and written to be as accurate as possible. The detail in the interiors of all rooms on the Titanic are fascinating and sitting watching this leaves you with your jaw dropped. The sounds and lighting used leaves you in awe from start to finish and the music is fantastic, love the soundtrack to this film!"

2015-11-23,leosmith-11166,"Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and superbly directed by James Cameron, is truly a beautiful story. The Film tells the story of the Titanic from a different perspective. Leonardo Plays Jack, as poor young man who just managed to get onto the Titanic, and Kate Winslet plays Rose, a rich young lady, whom with Jack does she fall in love DiCaprios acting is fantastic, same goes for Winslet.

A lot of people complain about their acting, saying it's cheesy and cheap. Well I have one thing to say to those people, and that is that the acting is Supposed to be cheesy. It's a Melodrama, and it's not trying to win Oscars for Acting.

Between the Spectacular Special Effects and the Tearjerking score, Titanic will surely leave no dry eye in the house. A Classic will live on."
2015-11-19,menghourly,"Titanic is a very popular movie since 1997 until nowadays. The movie is about actor nae JACK and actress name ROSE that fall in love with each other without thought about the richness or poorness. Rose is a daughter of rich family that will gonna have engagement with the person who she doesn't love from all her heart. Jack is a poor guy but very talented in drawing. Jack rescued Rose when Rose is about to jump from the ship into the sea. And they start chatting, and give Rose advice to live happiness and do something that Rose never done before. After that, they've fall in love with each other. Otherwise, they are break apart at the end. The first reason is Jack died by sink of ship and second is because of Jack isn't a rich guy. Anyway, Jack is my favorite character because he can change Rose life to be a happiness girl, he's talent, and he have a pour heart. I feel real from Jack, he's amazing. The favorite part of the book is when he tried to calm Rose from stop jumping from the sea, because he's really give Rose a best advice to go on her life, and don't get away from trouble. Sad scenes were types of scene written particularly well is when the ship is sinking and everyone are crying, telling kid that there is no problem on the ship and just go to bed, but the truth is they're gonna die soon. The last but not least is when the musicians keep playing their instruments to calm people's feeling. The book make me smile on love scene and cry at the end. I don't know why but when I read till the end of each page, I still keep turning to new pages. To be honest, the book is really take my heart and my soul into it. I do really appreciate this book, it never out of update. I think the story is great and I don't have any dislike part. There's no book would compare to this book. That's my opinion to the book. I would mark out for 9 over 10 for this story. The story is too good to read, people could fell or imagine the true at that time. I would recommend this story to all people to read."

2015-11-03,flsr,"Titanic(1997) is my favourite movie.I had watched this move 10 years ago,and I had also watched the movie Titanic 3D (2012)on 2013. Titanic enriches us with a romantic story of young love, passion and feelings, full of utopias and dreams, mother and child fighting for power and greed, idealistic and self-identified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity. This is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years. The huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that Titanic has one of those stories full of strength and feeling, with great dramatic content. If we add the stunning beauty of the image, thanks to advances in digital technology, success is understandable. Very successful movie, which tells the story of the sinking of the ship, but in the background shows a passionate love story. It achieves a harmonious balance in that, in the mix of history and feelings, and makes it almost perfect."
2015-10-31,rapso-45199,"WHAT A WONDERFUL MOVIE! I've been talked for years and years that I had to see that movie, that it was great, one of the best movies ever etc. but without really knowing why it didn't inspired me at first. Luckily a friend of mine forced me to watch it with her and I'm so grateful for that! I enjoyed every single moment of the film and I can't wait to see it again! It's well-played, the main character is handsome, the storyline is brilliant and moreover I found the actor's cues really funny. The only little thing I 'regret' would be the fact that it's really long but actually I was so 'catched' by the story that it didn't seem that long. A would certainly recommend it! You absolutely can't miss it!!!"
2015-10-24,o-fosnes,"I really love this movie. Leo and Kate is great in this movie. I've watched this movie with commentaries and i like the way James Cameron tells about what really happened in 1912 and what life was like at that time.

I love all the rooms in the boat that they have made exactly as in the real Titanic. I love the scenes when all the rooms come underwater and the deleted scene when leo and lovejoy fight in the dining room. Its the longest scene ever taken out of a movie. I also like the simulation of the boat when its underwater.

It's my favorite movie with Leonardo dicapro and Kate winslet."
2015-10-12,weesharobb,"The sinking of the RMS Titanic is still known to be one of the most resounding events to take place in generations past. The film Titanic is a romanticized version of the heartbreaking story of that ""Unsinkable Ship."" In this film we follow Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) as they fall in love with the ship, and each other. Their love is a Romeo and Juliet kind of story, with Jack being of the lower class and Rose being of high class from a wealthy family. Rose must make a choice to either listen to her mother and marry the man her mother chose for her, or to follow her heart and be with Jack. This movie keeps you intrigued and focused all the way till the end.

How Jack and Rose met was an odd story. Jack ended up winning tickets for both him and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci) for the Titanic in a ""Lucky hand of poker."" They both were of the lower class and were staying in the lowest floors. When they were out walking around on the deck, Jack looked up and saw Rose and it was love at first sight! He knew she had to be rich because she was on the higher deck. He knew he would have to find a way to talk to her.

One night Jack heard a scream and ran to see who it was, and it was Rose. She was hanging of the front of the ship. He ran to help her and the guards saw. This was the start of the love story of Titanic. Throughout the movie we see Jack and Rose grow closer and closer. Eventually Rose chooses Jack and lets her fiancé, Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), know about their blooming love. They begin to get into a lot of trouble throughout the ship and out of nowhere the ship hits an iceberg. They then must decide what they are going to do to survive. We follow their decisions in the last moments of the ship and possibly their lives!

Titanic won numerous awards including an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Titanic has some of the most eye-catching and well done camera work of any movie I have seen. The scene with Jack and Fabrizio on the front of the ship looking out is such a stunning image. The sun is just beginning to set. This scene even makes us feel like we are ""The king of the world!"" We can really see how high up they are and that they are in the middle of the ocean. The camera then pans down to the ocean and we can see dolphins swimming next to the ship.

Titanic also won an Oscar for Best Picture, and rightfully so! The story is so original and unique, even though it is something so familiar to all of us. How the film makers mesh together all the scenes to make us feel like it is really happening right before our eyes is just spectacular! The colors are so vibrant and give you a feeling of warmth and closeness. The literary aspects of the movie have become the reason why so many of us watch and re-watch this film time and time again. The story line just keeps you wanting more. Rose and Jack's love story is something we all want to feel some time or another in our lives, but maybe not the whole sinking ship and cheating on your fiancé thing. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job portraying their love for one another. You really are able to see it in their eyes. Overall Titanic is one of the most classic and fascinating films you are going to see. To this day, I still want more."
2015-10-12,atuell,"Titanic is an emotional, heart wrenching roller coaster type of film. One minute you will be laughing at how cute Leonardo DiCaprio is and the next minute you will be crying as you watch the ship sink into the deep ocean. The film's sole purpose was to one, show the history of the ""unsinkable"" ship, but on the other hand it takes a closer look at the passengers on the ship. There were two different types of people on the Titanic, the upper class, which was filled with the wealthy and well off people, and then there was the lower class, full of poor and not so well off people. As the movie progresses you see who belongs to where and how the classes get along with each other. As it introduces the characters, we the audience all fall in love with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) so does Rose (Kate Winslet). Rose is a young, gorgeous, wealthy girl traveling back to America to marry her horrible fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane), and Jack is a cute, intelligent, but poor boy who snuck onto the ship. In this interesting romance between Rose and Jack there's also a panic rising deep within Cal as he begins to realize there just might be something going on between Jack and Rose. Rose and Cal are part of the upper class and their costumes and dialogue really show their class well. By this i mean that Rose and Cal wear nice and neat clothes and expensive jewelry and they speak all proper and tight and clean. On the other hand you have Jack, he's part of the lower class and dresses kind of sloppy and in rags it looks like and his slang is in no comparison to the proper way of speech the class above him uses. Still though, Jack and Rose can see past each others flaws and riches and manage to fall in love almost instantly. But putting the romance and drama aside, there's something even more interesting about to happen, a mysterious iceberg. As we all know the ship Titanic is indeed, sinkable. As the ship is sinking, that's when things become real and suspenseful and emotional and scary. You're on the edge of your seating biting your nails literally praying for the inevitable. On another note, James Cameron did an amazing job recreating a completely believable Titanic. I honestly thought it was real i had no idea he recreated it on a computer. The sinking scenes were just as horrific on screen as they were the night it was a reality to so many people. I was so transfixed onto the screen i couldn't believe it. The cinematic for this movie were incredibly believable and just utterly beautiful. I do not think anyone else could have done a better job at recreating such a horrific night but still make it into a love story at the same time. The music was yet another memorable aspect of this film. It was warming and heart touching during the love scene. It then turned into a calm serene as the violinists play while the ship is sinking. When Jack and Rose are ""flying"" at the bow of the ship, the music that is playing was used for the mood and for the effect of the emotions being displayed on Rose's face as Jack touches her to help her ""fly"". The music is used to perceive the mood and emotions being displayed during a particular scene. Whether it was calm to frantic, or warm love back to sad with sorrow, the music was used in a most incredible way and it really made the scenes pop and stand out to me. Lastly, in my opinion you don't just watch this type of movie, you really feel everything the characters are feeling. When they were crying or screaming, then you were too. When Jack and Rose are falling madly in love, I was too. James Cameron set this amazing atmosphere for his audience that just reels us in and we can't be pulled out. Over all i can say that i love this movie. The historical details were on point, the story-line was just utterly beautiful but heart wrenching as well, the cinematography was used amazingly, and the music and characters were portrayed nicely. This film as both thumbs up from me!"
2015-10-12,guardbaby,"The Heart in a Sea

In the epic adventure that the movie, Titanic, takes you on, the characters ""Jack' and ""Rose"" develop not only as people separately but also as a couple. The historic event of the sinking of the titanic is depicted beautifully in the cinematography of the animated versions of the great, expansive ship and actual scenes of underwater footage and also the CGI, Computer Generated Imagery. As the story unravels, more and more of the characters are revealed. The great expansion of the voyage was built to be one of great proportion, being the fastest and strongest ship of its time. Leaving dock on a Wednesday afternoon, the tenth of April 1912. At promptly noon. A couple thousand passengers boarded the Titanic, expecting to be a part of history, only to meet their demise in an untimely collusion with an iceberg that could have been avoided. Believably, the Titanic stands on its own in the heart catching drama that twists and turns in ways that have you on your seat until the very end. ""Jack""- Leonardo DiCaprio, is the heart throb that have girls and women alike swooning at the blink of his eye. Having being able to board the ship, he greets ""Rose""- Kate Winslett, and develops an infatuation with the first class beauty, that he sees to have no chance with. Developing a story line in the first few minutes, the great expanse of the ship is a mighty sight to behold. From the hull of the ship to the back rudders under the water. Winning the Oscar for best cinematography was a just winning. From the scenes of the ship sailing to the final sinking of the ship. The sets that had to be created demonstrated the craftsmanship and theatrics. In the beginning, I viewed the movie as just another love story that could easily be dismissed. After watching closely and scrutinizing the details and multiple works that went into the movie I was astonished. Not only did James Cameron do amazingly with the actors he chose, but also every other aspect of developing the historic details of the event. The event itself was traumatic, while adding some of the personal stories to back it up gave the realism to how it affected the people that were aboard the ship. Obviously, some of the stories were make believe but, it pulled at the heart strings just enough to keep the audience from turning away from the underlying message. Personally, the scene that I was most impressed with would be the scene of the ship breaking completely in half and the events that followed. Backing up, the scene where the ship collides with the iceberg, a fact. The hit took approximately 37 seconds, the scene in the film was about that long as well. Filming this scene took editing genius and complete madness in commitment to the actor's roles."
2015-10-12,priya_patel-89866,"Titanic Review James Cameron's Titanic is a crazy love drama that brings people to love the movie more and more and it sucks you in it, and it is a crazy emotional roller coaster for any of the people that haven't seen it for the first and they are seeing it now you will be crying your hearts out. It is about two teenagers that fall in love in a boat on its way to New York, which brings the light out the boys and girls eyes and it help. Titanic is about a ship that is 'unsinkable' of the historical matter and the love stories from Rose (Kate Winslet) point of view of the movie throughout the whole movie. Rose is 17 years old and she feels in love with a boy that boards the boat Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio). Titanic won 11 Oscars for the filming and cinematography of the movie.

We meet Rose's character when she firsts gets on the ship to the SS Titanic she is a rich and classy she is in the 1st class of the ship she has a lot of money and she is engaged to Cal her fiancé and they are going to be getting married. Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio) first time we see him is when he is playing poker and he wins and he gets send to the SS Titanic to go on a trip with friend Fabrizio (Danny Nucci). The boat was about to leave but they made it to SS Titanic before it left the dock. How Jake and Rose is the most sweet cute amazing gesture I love it so much. The character of Rose and Jake played by (Leonardo and Kate Winslet). The cinematography of the movie is amazing and how they use the flashback scenes and how they switch with Old Rose telling the story back to the teenage rose. The developing of Jake and Rose in the movie and how Kate and Leonardo play the character and how to make it more developed and how the ship is the place that Jake and Rose fell in love for the first time and they are a young couple. It received a lot of money it received over $200 Million dollars. Jake and Rose loving and relationships in the movie shows a lot of how much the love in the movie develops and how it puts everyone in good, the cinematography in the movie is amazing some of my favorite cinematography scene is when the boat is about to sink and the color and the music changes and how the color changes though the movie and how they change up the color and sound of the movie. The cinematography of when Jack and Rose are hanging on the side and are on the railing of the boat and the color changes because of how the sunset and how they show the relationship with the time and the scene of the movie. The cinematography is amazing and that it is why they won a Oscar for best cinematography. Titanic won Best Picture,Best Director(James Cameron), Best Costume Design,Best Sound, Best Film Editing,Best Effects, Sound effects editing, Best Effects Visual Effects,Best Music Original Song, and Best Music dramatic score Leonardo and Kate were nominated for Best Actor and Actress but they never won and Leonardo has never won a Oscar and he deserve to win a Oscar. Titanic is amazing wonderful and it is a emotional roller coaster and it will put you through a lot, i watched it the first time and i love it and it is amazing movie it is going to be a amazing roller coaster. Titanic is a amazing movie and it is a roller coaster you might love it as much as me.Titanic is a great movie such a great romantic drama movie."

Even though everyone knows how the movie will end, the movie keeps you on your toes and never loses your attention, it focuses on a love story more than the massive tragedy. There will probably never be a movie that matches the creativity and wittiness of the Titanic. If you didn't enjoy this movie then you must've been in a bad mood while you watched it for fell asleep halfway through, if you paid attention then you will no doubt love the movie.

The movie is an epic action packed romance with a few comical scenes tossed in here and there. The beginning and the end of the movie was beautiful, minus the massive tragedy that ended in painful deaths for most of the passengers. One of the main characters, Rose, was slowly converted from the rich snobby lifestyle to the poor, having fun lifestyle. The shots and special effects of that which was in the Titanic were unmatched be the movie that has ever been seen at the time, the camera angles are the excellent and the sound in the background is excellent.

The Titanic won several Oscars, all of them well deserved. The most prestigious award was the academy award for best picture. It also won an academy award for best director, a Kid's choice award for favorite movie, and an Academy award for best cinematography. The line ""Jack, I'll never let go."" Was brilliant and ended up being one of the most famous lines in movie history, for good reason. There were numerous lines just as clever and meaningful as that line, many went unnoticed but they were there."
2015-10-12,katelynmichellex,"Titanic (1997)

Titanic, released in 1997, is a timeless film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The film is set in the ocean traveling from Europe to America, on a grand ""unsinkable"" cruise ship.

In the beginning of this movie, the quote was said ""not even God himself could sink this ship"", which is foreshadowing the events we know not just in the movie, but also in real life. This quote was said to have been spoken in real life, 1912, when the ship actually sank. It was a fantastic move on the director's part, not only to foreshadow the ship sinking in the movie, but to retain the historical accuracy of the story, at least as it is believed.

The directors and producers of this movie started off showing real footage of the sunken ship, mixed with some CGI footage, however, you can't tell the difference. Upon coming across a safe hidden inside the ship, they removed it and brought it to the surface, hoping to find money or treasure. However, the only thing they find undamaged is a painting, of whom they don't know. Soon, they DO find the woman in the painting. Her name is Rose (Gloria Stuart). Rose comes to the researchers and they show her computer footage of how the ship sank, scientifically. Rose then tells them ""That's quite interesting, however, the experience was quite different."" She then goes into detail of the story of the titanic, bringing it back to life, and telling her experiences on board by her younger self (Kate Winslet) and the love of her life she meets a little later, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Throughout the movie, the directors switch between the story of young Rose and Jack on the ship, to old Rose telling the story.

During the story that old Rose is telling, you see it played out on the screen, mostly in CGI. The difference between what is real and CGI is almost undetectable. The entire ship itself, along with the 300+ people on the deck, are all CGI. I think the directors and crew working with the CGI did such a wonderful job, and I personally didn't know the difference between what was CGI and real film until watching a short documentary on the subject. The script writing for this film was amazing. The movie draws you in and shows you what it would have been like aboard the titanic in both first and third class. When Rose meets Jack, you can feel the connection they have together and it's heartbreaking when her mother says she doesn't want them to be together. The film uses a lot of emotional appeals to make you feel for the characters, especially when the ship sinks. You fall so in love with these characters that I find it almost impossible not to cry. Overall, Titanic was an amazing movie and I recommend everyone watch it at some point."
2015-10-12,teababy-67170,"Titanic, directed by James Cameron, earned a whopping 11 Oscars in one night. Those Oscars include; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing, Best Effects, Visual Effects, Best Music, Original Song, For the song ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Céline Dion, Best Music, Original Dramatic Score. It also earned 7.7 stars on IMDb public voters. In my option Titanic was one of the greatest movies of all time, because of the great acting scenes and the emotion bond connection I am able to make with the characters, and with Leonardo DiCaprio staring in the film was just the icing on the cake.

Titanic is a movie about a rich girl, Rose (Kate Winslet) and a poor boy, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) or helplessly falls in love with each other. But Rose (Winslet) is engaged to a rich business man named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Even though Rose (Winslet) doesn't want to marry Cal, her mother wants her to marry him because they are in need of money. While on the flip side, Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is a poor 'floater' who moves from place to place looking to make quick money so he can survive. When he first sees Kate it was love at first sight for him, but he doesn't know she is engaged. Later in the film Kate and Jack fall in love and spend as much time together, of course Rose's fiancé finds out and like any normal man gets extremely upset and jealous. When he tries to put a stop to it, it backfires in his face. Meanwhile Captain Edward James Smith (Bernard Hill) gets a message that there is an ice burg ahead, but he ignores it so he doesn't upset Mr. Ismay, who wants to keep the boat moving in full speed. He has people on the lookout, but they don't see the ice burg until the last minute. The Titanic hits the side of the ice bug causing a big hole in the side of the boat. As the boat quickly fills with water, people start to freak out and many lives will be lost as the water engulfs the 'Unsinkable boat'.

To me the second best aspect of the film would defiantly be the music. The first being the characters, but we'll save that for another day. The music in the Titanic helped build the suspense and also add to the theme. My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Céline Dion, is one of the best songs in the film. When they added the song to the background, the ship was sinking, and you saw the fright and terror in everyone's eyes. It made your heart fill with sorrow and turned on the waterworks. It was a strong scene with little action, but it spoke loud and clear, and at the end became of the best scenes in Titanic.

My overall opinion of the movie is it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. If you want to see a classic movie that will make you cry this is the first movie I will suggest to anyone. Even if don't like some of the actors or actresses, you will inevitably fall in love with them through the Titanic. If I were to give this movie my own personal rating, it would be a trillion times infinity."

2015-09-28,InHong,"The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event. I feeling that your life must have once watching ""Titanic"", you will understand what the movie is successful.Finally, no matter how watching again, the movie couldn't boring."
2015-09-22,joshuadrake-91275,"This is going to be a short review for Titanic.

Plot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth watching is ""A Walk to Remember"", starring Mandy Moore and it is a movie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute picture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during it's ill-fated maiden voyage.

Characters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but the dialogue is very clichéd and cheesy in a few areas. The characters are all well portrayed and I give to the two main actors, also credit to Billy Zane, who plays Cal, he is the character you want to hate. Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Frances Fisher, Johnathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Bill Paxton and the late Gloria Stuart, who plays older Rose in this film and she should have deserved an Oscar.

Visuals: This is where the movie shines. James Cameron wanted to make a movie about the Titanic and it shows, with it's $200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The ship's sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI and practical effects and it is awesome.

Sound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic. James Horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic. The film's theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Celine Dion and I love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and I listen to this version and it was fantastic.

Enjoyment: TITANIC is a good classic, epic romantic disaster film that I have no problem watching once in a while. The film won 11 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Song. It made $2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic. 10/10."

2015-08-05,nadeemkhanbhati,I am loving it. This is really a greatest movie. This was the first Hollywood movie I had seen. I am really a big fan of this movie. This is an excellent movie. This is a fantastic movie. Everyone on this earth must watch this movie. The story of the movie is marvelous. I have watched this movie a number of times. I cry every time when I watch Titanic. This is a cool movie. I want to watch this movie before I die. I love this movie. This movie is considered one of the toppest movie according to me. This movie is honestly one of the superb movie. Everybody on this earth must watch this movie before they die. It must be made the government rule.
2015-08-01,The_Silent_Heroes,"The long-awaited advent of the most expensive movie ever made, the reportedly $200 million ''Titanic,'' brings history to mind, and not just the legendary seafaring disaster of April 15, 1912. Think back also, exactly 58 years ago today, to the Dec. 19 New York premiere of another grand, transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess, cataclysmic upheaval and character-defining trial by fire.

A film that sweeps us away into a world of spectacle, beauty and excitement, a realm of fantasy unimaginable without the movies.

James Cameron's 194-minute, $200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted and spellbinding. If its story stays well within the traditional formulas for such pictures, well, you don't choose the most expensive film ever made as your opportunity to reinvent the wheel."
2015-07-18,tommoboi,"What a wonderful film. James Cameron done a brilliant job bring this historical event to life. Everything was perfect, the timing of the film, the effects , the cast can't fault Cameron. You couldn't of asked for any better actors/ actress to fill the main two roles Leo and Kate have some much chemistry on film and you can feel the love and heartbreak between them outstanding acting. The fact this film is based on true even gives you that extra edge that you wanna see the film makes you feel the pain that actually happened. The number of awards says it all for this film. One of only two films along with Avatar to gross over 2billion incredible. If anyone has not watched this film they are missing out it is purely just a cult film. People off all ages love this film, male or female too. The thrills, love, heartbreak, excitement will draw you in to the most amazing love and historical film to ever hit the big screen. MUST WATCH FILM!!"
2015-07-06,nzpedals,"There are three stories here, all very well written and produced. We all know the basic story of the ship the Titanic, but Cameron's depiction of the actual events is so much better than any written account.

We see the captain, we see the doubts as he weighs up the pressures he is under from the ship owners, and the publicity people. Then, later, he has to face the reality that his ship is going to sink and he is probably going to die, probably unpleasantly. And we see the ship's designer and builder. We see the officers and the crew and all the problems they face and how they react. Sometimes well, sometimes not. We see the wealthy first-class passengers and their life of luxury, now they face death and can't do anything about it.

The production of all these events is impressive, walls bursting, floods of water, people sliding down the tilted deck, falling off. Then we see the horrible sight of the lifeboats as they search for anyone still living in the freezing water. So graphic, as is the first scenes of the modern attempt to recover items from the wreck, especially the way they explain to Rose what physically happened. Clever.

I suppose most viewers will concentrate on the story of Jack (Dicaprio) and Rose (Winslet). But this part, although very well done, is quite ordinary, just another love/lust story. He saves her life, she saves his later. Not many standout scenes or dialogue for either of them.

The third part of the story is Rose, 84 years later. The casting by Mali Finn is great. Gloria Stuart is a recognizable older version of Rose and including her joins many of the events throughout the film. Very clever, well done Mr Cameron."
2015-06-30,Leofwine_draca,"You know, I love disaster movies, and you don't get much bigger a disaster flick than TITANIC, James Cameron's magnum opus, a massively-budgeted and massively award-winning 1997 film that swept the board at the Oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made. Yet I only enjoyed half of it, and that's due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy, sappy romance story.

Cameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it: from his early sci-fi movies to THE ABYSS and AVATAR, he's great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage. When he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship, this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disaster.

When it comes to human characters, Cameron is a much less assured writer. The romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee. The characters are one-dimensional, from DiCaprio's irritating commoner to Winslet's utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him. Their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era. The less said about the likes of Billy Zane's cardboard cut-out villain the better.

In the end, we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes, and then things pick up, although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue. It's 2/3 romance and 1/3 disaster, and while the disaster stuff is great, the romance is execrable. A NIGHT TO REMEMBER remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy; I feel Cameron's TITANIC does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night."

2015-05-28,Justjsm,"When the movie was released, I was just 2 years old and I have no idea what was going on. I watched the movie when I was 12 and didn't get it all because English is not my first language. But I remember that it's the first movie that brought me to tears. And then I watched the movie 2 years ago, I was 17 years old (year 2012). That's when I fully understand the story. And this year I rewatched the movie. And still I feel the same way as I was years ago. What can I say?!? I'm really moved and to be honest, I talked about it with my friends the whole week and they all laugh at me because it's been years that Titanic was released and they said that I can't move on about the film, and that I'm obsessed about it. Well I raised my forehead and proudly said ""YES I AM.""

HELLO?! That's titanic! You're a complete idiot if you're not moved by the story and if you don't find yourself googling about it, thinking about what could've happened if Jack was still alive, and you can't get enough of it. I may not have my own Jack, but this film really makes me feel that I have one. Jack's life was full of happiness and adventure. While Rose suffered from being prison by her family's decision. Jack sacrifices his life for Rose to have a life that she always wanted, to see the world in a different perspective. Love and promises kept her alive and Jack is a big part of it. True love really last forever as long as you have that person in your thoughts and inside your heart. True love is about making sacrifices. True love is a promise kept forever."

2015-05-12,james1080-272-547223,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures of all time, an already great movie now even more spectacular in 3D. This whopper of a movie spans three hours of beautiful sets, incredible visuals and a stunning cast who deliver performances so strong that you immediately connect with their characters.

I'm not one for love stories or romantic dramas but Titanic is simply a must-see, as it's blend of love, adventure and loss is incredible, and James Cameron is a master in suspense building. A few friends of mine say that they skip the first hour and a bit and just go straight to the sinking part, I told them that's ridiculous, and the reason being is that you won't care about who dies or the outcome at the end, you have to watch the whole movie, it's a breathless adventure that will live on and be remembered as a classic. Everybody knows the story, but now it's been re-mastered in 3D and it's even more alive. The moment you see the Titanic the crowds look even bigger as they sprawl alongside the docks, cranes lift boxes which appear to lift off the screen and the sweeping shots that pan over the ship are just incredible. The depth throughout the movie is vast and jaw dropping to look at. All dialogue scenes boast incredible spacing between every little object from cups to candles, and I love the scene where Jack holds Rose over the edge of the Titanic and holds her arms out, you can almost touch them, this is the best 3D conversion to ever grace Blu-Ray. He nailed Avatar in 3D, Sanctum was a stunner in 3D and now James Cameron has done it again.

Then there's the climax, probably the most memorable and stunning climax in cinema history: The sinking of the Titanic. The scale here is mind blowing, as thousands of sailors and passengers flee in terror desperately trying to get on board the life boats, fighting for a space. I like how human nature and morals have been shown in this climax, how the crew leave the lower class people behind the shutters to drown which is saddening, and the greed and desperation of the upper class people fighting to get off the ship. The 3D here only heightens the terror, when passengers look over the sides the depth effects enable the viewer to tell just how far down the fall really is! The corridor scene where Rose and Jack try to flee is a marvel in 3D, don't get me wrong the 2D counterpart is spectacular still but the way the water seems to leak our your TV screen is frightening. This whole finale will have you on edge, once the ship itself tips and sinks the depth just goes into overdrive, look at the distance from where Rose hangs dangerously to beneath her. I will highly recommend this movie in 3D, if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the Blu-Ray like me then you are in for one hell of an experience.

I don't really cry at movies, it takes an awful to get me weeping, even in real life situations but Titanic is a master tearjerker. For the last hour I honestly balled my eyes out, the soundtrack and score is wonderful as that peaceful vocal echoes in nearly every key scene. The four violin players stay to play their final performance as the ship goes down. The Captain goes back to wheel to go down with his ship. An elderly couple lye in bed as the water floods in. A single mother reads a bedtime story to her kids as their side of the ship goes down. Once the ship goes down more sad sets in. The sound of Rose frantically trying to shout for help, and when she lets go of Jack the tears start flooding in. This climax is hard hitting, lump-in-throat inducing and one heck of an emotional payoff. It gets sweeter when Old Rose drops her necklace into the Ocean, and when young Rose names herself Rose Dawson. This is as best as I can describe the beauty of the end. This classic story has never felt more alive, a fantastic conversion and still one of the epic movies of our time."

2015-05-11,gavin6942,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.

The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like ""Terminator"", ""Avatar"" and ""Aliens"". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. ""Titanic"", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.

But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film."

2015-03-08,davispittman,"Titanic is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made, especially by the Academy in the year it came out. I believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years. i know there are people that claim it's terrible and i think it's mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved.

Ok so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done. Winslet and DiCaprio are both doing their absolute best here, which is great because they really are two very gifted actors. i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them. I think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done, handled well. The expressions on their faces portray real love and affection, but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too. The other actors are very convincing as well, one that deserves praise is Kathy Bates, who plays Molly Brown. She had a great, believable energy about her, and she provides some fun comedic relief too. Gloria Stuart is so amazing here, she might be my favorite member of the cast, it may be a tie between her and DiCaprio because they're both so great.

The visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible! They still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch. The soundtrack is great and I think it fits the film's tone. Overall, James Cameron knows what he's doing and he has people around him who also know what they're doing, so it results in a wildly entertaining, smart film, one that I will forever call a masterpiece."

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!

Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!"
2015-01-11,CalRhys,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on."
2015-01-04,runamokprods,"There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic"" – the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc.

Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama.

I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once."
2015-01-03,patstaciemcgue,"I saw this movie in the theatre's back in 1997 and remembered it as a brilliant movie. The cinematic experience was one of the best of my life even though the story is tragic and very sad. I recently watched this film with my 13 year old daughter. The magic is still there. This is still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatest love story of all time. The new blue ray release is fantastic and James Horner's score is still timeless. Great job James Cameron...for producing a once in a lifetime film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were fantastic in this film and both deserved best actor/actress awards.

Don't be afraid to bring this one back out people... its still a beautiful epic that will stand the test of time."
2015-01-03,hkrishnan633,"Titanic may be a spoiled little drama. But it's the most astounding, wonderful romantic movie I've ever known.1st half is a bit boring. And you may feel this movie is crappy at times. Also, the love story between the lead couple isn't mentioned fully.But, from the I'm flying scene, the story gains momentum. The 2nd half is spectacular and by the end, it leaves the viewers crying. The most emotional movie ever, Titanic gives you an experience which no other romantic tragedy could. It is the most magical, poetic and picturesque piece of romantic movie work. Hats off to you Cameron, for creating an unforgettable drama of emotions, trust, love, ambitiousness, endurance, survival and of all, grief when lose the one you loved. I love you Titanic. I'll never let go of you Titanic. Never let go."
2014-12-22,stormhappy106,"OK, the last hour was great, technically speaking--The people running up and down the ship, the lifeboats, the ship cracking up, and when one of the huge smokestacks falls onto the passengers in the water, the visual and sound effects were incredible--That is the best scene in the film, and one of the best scenes in movie history.

BUT, the miscasting of Leonardo was a huge mistake--Leonardo looks like a schoolboy, and a funny-looking one at that, with his beady little eyes--There is nothing remotely ""manly"" or ""heroic"" about this little twerp. Everyone else in the film was fine, especially all the British Actors.

Until the iceberg actually hits, you will be bored out of your mind, despite the impressive recreation of the boat's interior and clothes of the cast.

2014-11-30,MehdiTaba,"First of all I need to say James Cameron is a genius, he done this masterpiece really precisely, he done a tons of researches for getting the best result, even the floor coatings' color/shape/texture.

James Cameron in some Interviews said: ""still there is some errors in some parts"" but I need to say come on... it's perfect, a little detail can not corrupt anything!

If I wanna talk about Titanic there is hundred things that I can mention but here's some of them.

Titanic is my favorite and number one movie ever because it's perfect in all the forms of film making, for example: Visual effects are perfect, Score and soundtrack are one of the best in cinema's history, Cinematography is perfect, Casting and Acting is great, Plot is great, Emotions throughout the film is superb, Directing is best, Production is extremely great, Entertaining level is more than any wants, Costume and production design is really precise and beautiful...

Love story in Titanic pictured perfectly, things such as: Emotions, love, looks, heart beats, remission, sacrifices, pleasures...

Even disaster of this ship and its passengers pictured and worked perfectly.

There is a great thing about this, you just wanna follow the whole things in the film 'til the end, all the scenes are beautiful even disasters and discrimination between British/Irish passengers!

There is just two things that I'm not completely alright with it: 1. length (not so much just about half hour!) 2. originality (Titanic made in the past dozens of times)

My final and precise rating for Titanic is ""9.5"".

I extremely recommend it to wise, emotional and lovers of cinema! I know some people who hate Titanic and all of them are extreme and irrational people!!!

I watched Titanic more than any movie out there!! 'cause I can feel it totally.

A big ThAnX for James Cameron for doing this and you for reading this.

Have fun."
2014-11-27,Wuchakk,"The hype surrounding James Cameron's ""Titanic"" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.

The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.

This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.

Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to ""high society"" to still relate to the ""commoners"" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.

Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.

The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.

Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but – remember – she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion!

As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to ""Never let go."" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).

It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.

Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate ""Titanic.""

GRADE: A"
2014-11-24,christophershobris,"We all know what the film is based of off, and we expected that. But what I'm sure that audiences didn't expect was a plot as deep as it gets. With an amazing and large cast, Titanic offers more teardrops then a funeral. One thing that stands out over everything else is the fantastic musical score by James Horner and Celine Deon. Possibly the best since Hans Zimmer in the Lion King in 1994. Titanic released in 1997 changed cinema as we know it. Offering a deep, and emotional story with performance you will enjoy with your eyes, and music that you will be humming for years to come. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates are amongst one of the largest cast in film history (up to that point). It is a film you will have to see to not only believe, but enjoy as well. This is James Cameron's Titanic."
2014-11-23,himbletony,"This movie is tiresome in the extreme, totally over-hyped, over-rewarded and ridiculous. I first saw it when it first came out and the interminable amount of time it took before the iceberg hove into view was mind-numbing.

So many problems. The opening framing device was totally unnecessary and felt sooooo long, while adding nothing to our understanding, nor even piqueing our interest (wasn't that supposed to be the intention?).

Then the cast of stereotypes! Awful, and all saddled with flat, uninspired dialogue or worse still, retrospective smart-alec bits (""Picasso? He won't amount to much"", ""Freud? Who is he? Is he one of the passengers?"" .....groan).

The fatal casting of Leonardo di Caprio, still in his baby face mode as a well travelled man of the arts (???), while Kate Winslett, mature and a little blowsy (nothing wrong with that) appears almost old enough to be his mother, is a serious misjudgement. Her fiancé (a luckless Billy Zane) lacked only a moustache that he could fiendishly twist in his most unctuous moments. A total pantomime creation (the villain in Avatar was a similar one dimensional character).

I saw the beginning on TV recently and watched again up until Kate is rescued from leaping off the stern. I hoped that I might be able to reassess it. No chance. It got me just as annoyed as the first time, the improbabilities just as ludicrous (would the crew REALLY have allowed Leo and chum to the bow to yell ""King of the world""?). The only reason this got two stars was for the technical sequences during the sinking, but as for the fate of the protagonists, by that stage I was past caring. If only they had employed a talented screen writer. Such a waste."
2014-11-11,prabhatrayal,"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I didn't find a single reason to love it.

It's long, boring and ends in a pathetic way. Those who say the ship- wrecking scene is great in terms of visuals need to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey which has much better visuals than this movie and was made in 1968 (its a sci-fi about space).

This is a complete waste of time. It's way too long. It's so boring. It's a bad love story. There are no great visuals as people say. The fanboys are worst. Cameron is a great director but sorry this movie sucks. I wasted my 3 hours on this piece of garbage."
2014-11-10,melissarmcdougall,"It is a normal love story with a bit action. I personally think it is way to over hyped. I bet it is because it is based on a real story. Everyone loves it and they say that it is such a beautiful movie but I honestly don't think so. I mean it is okay but it really does not deserve the hype it got now. When it came out maybe, okay I give it that.

But not now. It just got boring because you know what happens even before you ever saw it, you just know it because you have to.

But it got the girls on it's side, I'll give it that. When can live thru a boring movie for a girl, do it."
2014-10-28,utdman4,"I remember the hype surrounding this movie and coming from the same part of the world where the titanic was built I thought this will be great. Well I watched this on video and was stunned' take a historical disaster and turn it into a romance novel' lol james Cameron has arrived. Its a real shame because I really liked the terminator' but that was when he was broke and visual effects were in its infancy the irony is the more money he makes the worse the movie and its not like this was a one off' it spawned other historical disasters like pearl harbour which was a titanic rip off. But the main problem for me was the whole movie surrounds the three main characters and everyone else on the ship was just window dressing and I like a lot of other guys couldn't wait until the ship sank. The only good thing I have to say is it made a big star out of dicaprio, and he has went on to bigger and better things. So this movie was a real bummer for me and a lot of others i'm sure."
2014-10-26,lediscipledessocrates,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received."

2014-10-20,melanie-pansy,"I loved when this movie first came out in theaters, I loved it on in that bulky VHS box, I loved it on DVD and well...you guessed it, I love it on Blu-Ray. some of the negative reviews are saying they had issues with either sound or playback. My BD played all the way through, from beginning to end without any issues OTHER THAN one small freeze up between a particular chapter change. I don't think I lost more than a second or two. It could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge. Either way I'm not complaining. It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie. So glad that I can own it in such high definition. It looks and sounds great. You see every detail of every scene like never before. They really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible, and we're talking about a movie that came out in the late 90's. Oh! And the commentaries and special features are great, STILL haven't gotten through all of them. Maybe I'll do that now...enjoy."
2014-10-13,sarah-132-61906,"Titanic Is A Commercial Movie With Half Naked Woman Scene &194 Minutes Of Absolute Boredom & Back Ache.

I Saw This DVD and I could not tolerate sitting more than 3 hours like a couch potato for a commercial movie that is filled with boredom.

Titanic Has Sex Scene Of Half A Naked Woman Posing Half Nude For The Painting. This Scene Caused The Movie To Be Purely Commercial & Perhaps Rated R For Nudity.

In My Opinion James Cameron's Movie Could Have Been So Much Better Without This Unnecessary Nudity Scene Unless He Wants To Attract People To Seeing It. We Know Very Much How Nudity & Sex Sells!."

Every time I watch it I feel like I experience a range off different emotions to the previous time watching it. Titanic is just such a beautiful thing it really does win the heart of the audience, the film makes you cry and laugh it is a tale of history and romance. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jack Dawson a character you can't help but fall in love with. This is one of James Cameron's brilliant pieces of work. I would recommend this film to anyone, It is beyond me how people can say they don't like this film I mean what is not to like?"

Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace.

I think that Titanic is THE movie to watch with your friends, family , or even alone . It's always a pleasure to watch Leonardo dicaprio excellent actor playing on this kind of movie, he's a genius . Kate winslet have also made a good effort into playing the role of a little rich girl in the boat of Titanic . The end of the movie was a little sad, but it worth seeing."
2014-07-17,hall895,"Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.

Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.

The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.

Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship."
2014-07-01,beuchertk,"The sinking of the Titantic is actually quite interesting, as anyone who has read a well-written book about the event can tell you. This film tosses away that story and replaces it with a cornball teeny bop-per love story that makes one want to puke, all the while slandering historical figures (like J Bruce Ismay, whom James Cameron has falsely portrayed as a prototypical heartless and cowardly businessman) and some others unfortunate enough to be a target of Cameron's biases. In the end, Cameron's film so far removed from reality that it's unlikely anything it contains would ever be taken seriously by anyone looking for the historical facts. I mean, when was the last time Hollywood presented real history? Probably 1964 when they filmed The Longest Day, whose script was religiously close to Cornelius Ryan's book. Since then, not much. The fact that Cameron had to make up a subplot wouldn't have been so bad, had it remained a subplot to the story of the sinking, and had it been realistic rather than such a trite piece of romantic nonsense. Cameron had the opportunity to make a definitive account of this well-known event and totally blew it. To tell history you need someone who is dedicated to historical truth, not someone determined to make the audience reach for their collective handkerchiefs. Shame on you, Mr. Cameron. What a colossal waste."
2014-06-25,Rainey-Dawn,"Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.

The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.

IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.

I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.

2014-05-21,zdh952,"I just watched this for the first time in about 15 years last night. I saw it when it came out, and i was entirely too young to appreciate it (i was about 9 when it came out). The movie over all holds up and it good but there are few things i don't care for. Visually, even 17 years later, the movie is a masterpiece. Sets, costume, cgi, all of it is a impressive as it was when it first came out. The first half of the movie is slow and plodding, which everyone complains about, but this is a love story, not a disaster movie, so I personally think those people need to readjust their expectations and watch this again. My big problem is the 2 leads. DiCaprio and Winslet are OK. But thats honestly about it. Lines are delivered (I feel) either flatly or are over acted. I see them falling in love and honestly it doesn't grab me. And that's not because I'm a guy, I love a good romance. Something about their chemistry just doesn't seem as genuine as i was expecting. Some of the lines at the end are painfully corny, especially DiCaprio's telling Winslet that she is going to ""make lots of babies"".... Seriously? That could have been beautiful, it's the gut wrenching end to a Romeo and Juliet love story, but I feel like that whole scene was written by an 8 year old. Kathy Bates, as always, I liked, and Billy Zane gets my vote for ""Best Scumbag in a Movie Ever"". I do like that Cameron make Winslet ""Transform"" as so many of his characters do (Sarah Connor and Ripley start out powerless and end up tearing the movie apart, and in much the same way Winslet starts as a trapped helpless woman, and ends the movie by taking an ax to doors and saving the lead male). That is done VERY well. I'm still giving this 8 stars because even though this may have snags that I don/t care for, the over all story and the setting are very very strong. The pathos of the passengers drowning or trying to save their children had a knot in my stomach and most of the characters are great, even if the 2 leads are only good."
2014-05-14,Eightiesjunkie,"To begin with, I liked James Cameron as a director. As a matter of fact, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. Throughout the 80's and mid 90's James Cameron could do no wrong, then it happened: Christmas 1997 James Cameron released the most overrated, over-hyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known: Titanic! I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing: I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old cliché-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is: They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing ""new"" is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include: Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly cliché, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is: This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own. In my opinion however, there will never be enough hatred for this film, Even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it, it still wouldn't be enough!"
2014-05-09,rajivsilvester,"This movie made me believe in Love. Just go for it, It's the best movie ever made in film history. I you haven't seen it then you definitely missed out something in life...There will only be one movie like 'Titanic', It's a movie for the ages..

The main highlights of this movie is Kate Winslet, Leo, James Horner's music score, stunning special effects and a superb love story

FYI: This is not just like any other romantic flicks, There is something more to it. This movie caught the imagination of a generation, During late 90's everyone was talking about this movie and everyone I knew had only one opinion about this movie and that is that this movie is so perfect and felt so real to them for it to be just a story. They started believing that rose and jack are for real..

Tips for enhancing the movie experience:

watch this movie with your Girl friend in a cold winter, preferably at night"
2014-04-12,FreddieDouglas,"Simply put, Titanic is one of the most overrated movies of all time, in terms of how much money it made, how many people seem to like it, and how many awards it won. While the performances from Dicaprio (playing Jack), Winslet (playing Rose) and other supporting roles like the ship Captain are solid, the film on a whole just isn't. To sum up the film in one word would be ""boring"" or ""generic"". Titanic does't become the disaster movie until the very end, up until that its an extremely generic ""poor-boy-meets-rich-girl"" love story, something thats been done a billion times before. The film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect the times, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, the characters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husband to be, are just lazily written with no character other than ""I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff"". The film overall is just a bore, and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually starts sinking. Absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever. One of the most overrated movies of all time."
2014-03-26,julieneven,"Titanic is a true story about the disaster of the Titanic who sunk in 1912, directed by James Cameron. The movie starts with a guy who is looking for a treasure, a diamond neck less, which would be hidden in the Titanic. When he goes searching, he finds a safe, but only with money and a drawing of a woman, Rose, who's wearing the diamond neck less. She sees this on TV and contacts the man. Then she starts telling her story : Rose took the boat to the U.S with her family and fiancé Caledon. Rose isn't happy and wants to kill herself but Jack is the one who saves her. That's the moment that Rose and Jack meet for the first time. Rose's family forbids her to have contact with Jack, but Rose refuses and falls in love with Jack.

They said Titanic was the best romantic movie of all times and I can't deny it. The movie has broken all the records in 1997 and won 11 Oscars! It's a really spectacular movie, one you must see at least ones. It's a story that everyone likes, you have romantic parts but also parts who are very exciting with a little bit action like the fight between Jack and Caledon. One of the pluses of the movie is the cast: Leonardo Dicaprio, Kate Winslet,... They are one by one great actors and actresses. The movie is based on a true story, most of the movie is historical correct and that's what I also like about the movie. You learn something about how it would have been and the actors represent it very well. At the end I really didn't doubt that Rose and Jack were truly in love. James Cameron made a movie with really great shots and special effects. In the beginning you see amazing shots on the bottom of the ocean from the real Titanic as well as the break up of the ship and the interior shots in the giant flooded tanks. Those shots make this movie so great. You can see where they putted so much money in.

Titanic is a masterpiece that tells the almost impossible love story of Rose and Jack, but also one of the worst disasters of all time. It's understandable why so many people watch it several times. I would definitely recommend it to other people."
2014-03-26,ryan_bass,"This movie doesn't put a foot wrong! Over a decade after I first watched it,this film still tears my heart out and throws it in my face.

Superb performances by the cast: a Golden Globe nod for DiCaprio (an Oscar nomination worthy performance? Decide for yourself), Oscar nomination for Kate Winslet and one for Gloria Stuart as well, who puts on an amazingly heartfelt retrospective performance. The film is worth a watch to see these alone.

The visuals in this film are also stunning, even sixteen years later they still don't look outdated, so if that is your thing it's well worth seeing.

A beautiful screenplay, well worth the three hour watching time to watch it unfold, you'll laugh and cry with realistic characters, dialogue and be awe-struck how the tragic scenario scenario provides a frame for the events.

Finally for the soundtrack buffs... In my opinion, perhaps the best soundtrack ever written (James Horner take a bow) well deserving of the Oscar win. Some tragically beautiful pieces, even if you don't watch the film, check out ""Rose"", ""Unable to Stay, Unwilling to Leave"", ""Hymn to the Sea"" and ""Death of Titanic"". All masterpieces in their own right.

This film is a well deserved 10/10 rating, if you haven't seen it then you should. Definitely in my top ten films to see before you die. A complete masterpiece."
2014-03-17,mcnasioutzik,"Over the years, it seems that people love to hate Titanic. Despite it's 11 Oscars and the fact that it is one of the largest ever box office successes(I think 5th, adjusting for inflation), over the years its almost as if its cool to hate Titanic. That the love story and the characters are cliché and soppy and the story is completely unrealistic. That only romantic, love-obsessed girls would watch it and cry about how they'll never get a man as gorgeous as Leonardio DiCaprio. The 'draw me like one of your French girls' is probably one of the most made fun of scenes in a movie that I've ever heard. These people fail to realize that Titanic is a movie. It's not supposed to be realistic - it shows a blown up, exaggerated version of reality to capture our imagination and our hearts. And it succeeds impressively. Leonardo DiCaprio is good, but not his best (watch The Departed or Wolf of Wall Street for Leo's acting abilities). Kate Winslet was probably slightly better. But the magic about Titanic is the story and the directing. From the beginning, the characters captivate you. They are not superficial - in contrary, they have flaws and advantages, just like everyone else. The movie is long but the pace is not slow. Every scene is necessary and Cameron does a great job in making us want this couple to make it. I don't need to mention that the music is exceptional, complimenting the atmosphere perfectly. The effects are good and very realistic (it shows that Cameron actually visited the Titanic before filming). Most of all, it is apparent that this movie is an epic. I definitely consider it as one of the best love stories of recent time. It is a little cliché and a little soppy, but I promise you won't regret watching it. So ignore the haters and go and enjoy it for what it is: a romantic drama with amazing characters, music, directing and background. Even if you hate it, at least you'll be able to laugh about it with your friends!"
2014-03-14,jOeLrOgErS90,"It gets me every time, I'm an emotion wreck at the end. Titanic is the only few films I have watched that is just as enjoyable as the first watch.

A 3 hour film normally requires dedication and sustain concentration with many films offend drag on but Titanic could be on for 6 hours and still be just as engaging.

Kate and DiCaprio are just so perfect for this role and are very believable in there performances. There's not one second that you think that there are acting in a film which says it all. Many people would say watching Titanic is a guilty pleasure but not for me its just a pleasure."

2014-02-19,laurenbrigittepool,"I have watched so many good movies. Some of the best of all time. But when I finished watching this movie I just wanted to watch it all over again. I have seriously never seen such an entertaining and good quality movie. I had watched parts of this movie a few years ago. Today I watched the whole thing for the first time in my life (I'm 15) and I cannot believe that someone could of produced a movie this good. The acting was so good I almost forgot that I was watching a movie. I cannot believe that someone had actually tried to make a second one because there is no way in hell it could beat this.

Lets also face it, Leonardo was extremely enjoyable to look at. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It doesn't matter what type of movies you like, I'm pretty sure Titanic covers all types of movies and you simply can't beat it. This is definitely my favourite movie now and I can't wait for tomorrow to start so I can watch it all over again after school tomorrow."

2014-01-14,thom0045,"Titanic is my personal favorite film...ever. It uses the best special effects and technology of it's time and even though those aspects are outdated now, I still find myself drawn in. I'm drawn in after so many years because of the great talent of Kate Winslet and Leo Dicaprio and their great chemistry together.

Those two, combined with the fantastic music, artistic direction, storyline, along with the technological aspects I've already mentioned creates an incomparable cinematic experience. I have never been so captivated by a single piece of media, before or since. I think it's the best...bottom line."
2014-01-10,kg_reid,"Having read real accounts of the Titanic disaster from eyewitnesses, as in Walter Lord's stellar book A Night to Remember, I can only laugh at how ludicrous James Cameron's rendition of this historical event was. All for sensationalism and turned into a mega-soap opera. Focusing on the plight of two 1990's teenagers decked out in costumes as if they inhabited 1912 but nobody was fooled. The whole thing was ludicrous as they slogged their way for hours in freezing ocean water in soaked clothing, ending up in the ocean of course -- but only she was saved. The only good part of this movie ""disaster"" was the first few minutes where they showed the salvage operation on the real Titanic."
2014-01-04,mdhaq123,"This is just like every other romance movies: boy and girl fall in love, their family won't let them marry each other, they eloped, boy dies from a tragedy, girl cries. Haven't we already seen movies like this? And the fact that this cliché and mediocre film received a s**load of Oscar nomination proves how dumb Oscar become. The only reason this movie made a s**load of money in box office is because of these girl teenagers. Seems to me Hollywood is making rehash films just like this movie. Make up something original for f*** sake. Don't end up like Bollywood that makes rehash films over and over again. If you don't then I might lose faith in you just like with Bollywood."
2013-12-30,MoviesAreLife93,"This film is a masterpiece. Every aspect of its production weaves together in a beautiful tale of tragedy, peril, and romance. The tremendous amount of effort that James Cameron and the entire cast put into this production is the essential reason that Titanic should never be forgotten, and should always be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a true work of art - and the acting, the production value, directing, visuals,and music score all contribute. I doubt very much that there will ever be a film that portrays the fate of Titanic with such elegance as this one. Although this film runs well over three hours, there is not one wasted scene. This deserved every Oscar it received, and I consider its rating of a 7.7/10 to be a borderline travesty; it should easily be in the top 250 if not an 8.5/10 or greater. I love this movie!"
2013-12-24,Caesarboy5,"Titanic and Avatar are very different. One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common: they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.

Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.

THE GOOD

There's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well.

So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing. It's well paced, the characters are well-developed, the cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the conflict is one that continues to exist today (people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures).

Like Romeo and Juliet, this film is a classic.

THE BAD

This is a nitpick. Cameron decided to make the film as if an older Rose is telling a captain the story via flashback. That's fine and it works well the entire film. But the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been.

The Captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the Heart of the Ocean, not Rose. That way it would show Rose's lesson got through to someone. Why even introduce the Captain and a conflict if they're just going to be forgotten at the end of the film.

Once again, a nitpick, but the movie is three hours. Why is the ending so rushed? I just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying ending.

VERDICT

Great film, 9/10, see it! Whether you'll like it or hate it, this is one of the four essentials of the 90's, along with Pulp Fiction, Terminator 2, and Forrest Gump."
2013-12-21,tristandetwiler,"Short one this time... might happen with movies that aren't on my Top 30 Favorite Movies of all Time List.

Plot:

If you want a historical representation of the Titanic story, just go watch A Night to Remember. The whole movie centers around a fictitious love story used to give the movie it's core appeal. It's whats used to connect the audience to the historical event. However, the story has gone beyond that. It's amazing to hear how modern teenagers and stupid children didn't know the Titanic was a real ship.

Characters:

Card-board cut out representations of real people on the Titanic and 2-D Personality characters (Fictional) thrown in for drama. I think Jack is the most bland character ever written in a motion picture. Cal Hockley is the star of the movie. Yes, he's the hero of the film. I was rooting for him, not the bizarre couple who acted like a#%holes.

Visuals:

Where the film shines easily. James Cameron labored to make the movie as historically accurate as possible. It's actually mind-blowing how complex and faithful the sets are to the real ship. The dresses, suits, attire, and objects used in the movie are key perfect for a period piece. The effects of the ship sinking are also very nice. The fact he used a real set and not Computer Generated Images is a good enough reason, but it looks great in the final picture.

Sound:

The score by James Horner is also very nice. It's a great mix of triumph, sadness, happiness, tragedy, and hope. The different tracks sound right for the situation. Some musical tracks that are used, for example, in the beginning of the movie, are interjected later into the movie to give the score a mix of, again, happiness and tragedy.

Enjoyment:

The movie had sell-out crowds for a year... it made over one billion dollars and was, at the time, the most successful film ever made. What else can I say? It was pretty great!"
2013-12-21,The-Sarkologist,
2013-12-15,SnoopyStyle,"Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is searching for a legendary gem called The Heart of the Ocean presumed lost on the Titanic. When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.

I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.

There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.

Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9/10."
2013-12-15,theburlyone,"I know that nowadays Titanic is seen as kind of a clichéd romance movie, but that's just not the case. Yes, romance is a large part of the plot but it is tasteful and very well done. I really don't understand why people knock this movie down... Not only is James Cameron a master film maker, DiCaprio and Winslett are both excellent actors. In fact, everyone in this movie down to the extras make this film a completely immersible experience. As for the cons, there really isn't any unless you're a history buff. In that case you should be reminded that this a very theatrical film and the creators took certain liberties. Anyway, beyond the review, yes... This movie did move me to tears and yes, I am a man. For Pete's sake, my nickname is Burly for a reason and I shed tears if that tells you anything about how this movie can rouse your emotions. What else is sad is that this movie, at the time of this review only has 7.5/10 on IMDb. It's not even on IMDb's top 250.

Advice for movie lovers: If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've already seen it, watch it again if you have the time. Titanic gets a 10/10 in my book."
2013-12-11,AaronCapenBanner,"James Cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic in April 1912. Among the many passengers is drifter Jack Dawson(played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who meets unhappy heiress-to-be Rose Dewitt(played by Kate Winslet) and fall mutually in love as disaster strikes the ship, resulting in its sinking, and the loss of many lives. An old version of Rose(played by Gloria Stuart) recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure hunters(led by Bill Paxton) who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck, which Rose does indeed know something about... Hated by some, resented by others, I still love this film, which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture, with outstanding F/X that are still realistic. The full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all, which is put in proper perspective. Some dialogue could have been better, it's true, but compelling drama at its best, leading to an emotionally devastating end. Deservedly won many Academy Awards, including best picture, director, and song ""My Heart Will Go On""!"
2013-12-07,amastarwars,
2013-11-26,OllieSuave-007,"This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience's hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.

Many of the movie's element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.

The scenes of each character's fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).

This movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty cliché - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.

Grade C"
2013-11-22,mimi-andreeva_1995,"That's a movie of real beauty, of real love and of the real hard life. Running over three hours Titanic became the most successful film of the history of cinema. Extravagant, inspiriting, astounding, poetic, romantic and totally unforgettable. Enormous emotive power. It's a terrific balance of realism and romanticism. Every time I watch it there are tears in my eyes. The story could not have been written better - the juxtaposition of rich and poor, the sorrow and the increasing fear in the eyes of everyone on the board, the hidden message that life is uncertain, you don't know what is ahead of you and you have to live every single moment while you are still here on that planet. With that masterpiece Mr. Cameron proved that he is the king of the cinema."
2013-11-14,Theraxorterminate,"What more could you say about Titanic? Well maybe a 100 million things more about it? When it comes to Titanic you'll always think of the vision and directing of James Cameron. And even though the whole story upon the disaster isn't 100% accurate I still think James was able to give a beautiful and strong directing not only the suffering and fear of the sinking but the love with Leo and Kate too. Basically Titanic is a more adventurous and maybe a little modern look on Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. And I think it worked good to show the beauty of the ship and the love.

The acting is beautiful, I didn't see any actors who felt forced or even ignored the ways how James wanted to do as he visioned. They take it seriously without anything that seems like they didn't wanna do it. Leo gives a very good performance as the unknown boy who tries to help the desperate girl to feel more alive. In my opinion Leo does not look too boyish on this performance, no in fact he really showed to be like a man. I still enjoy his acting to this day, now when he had turned more macho than ever. Kate gives a good performance that shows the feelings from someone who's rich but still there's many things she can do in her life.

The special effects are gorgeous, they don't look fake at all and even looking on Blu Ray it still looks realistic with a little improvement on certain scenes. (Don't worry I don't think James Cameron will be the next George Lucas because these changes are very minimal on some material that were unnecessary to have or something that was missing.)

Sure Titanic is long and does not exactly have the most original story, but everything else is just perfect for it's ""recreation"" of the ship, the special effects and the acting. And yes it's true that there are still many people who dislikes or even hate this movie. Many people these day's seems to forget that the word ""hate"" is much harsher than ""dislike"". The movie is certainly not the world's greatest film of all time.

Is it the worst? No, but certainly very overrated and even though I have heard many of my family recommending it I wanted to take a look on the movie on my personal vision and take a calm moment and concentration if the movie really delivers. And yet it did.

But in case for those who are wondering I like or love many other movies than this. I understand that people who had heard from the positives that you really need to see this and the result for them they become flabbergasted or annoyed. But then, why should we always manage to see a movie that won for best picture when there are hundreds of other great movies out there. So don't feel so forced about seeing Titanic, see it when you really have time to see the whole of it but ignore also those who praise it or hate it, that's what I did and it felt better."
2013-11-02,ykalsh2223,"Titanic is one of the most popular movie. When you watch this movie for the first time, you are probably going to be sad. It's been created in a wonderful way and I'm sure that if James Cameron has the same equipment that helped him to create Avatar, he would have created this movie in an incredible way. The only weak spot is James had not given a space to talk about other people who had died in that disaster. He had concentrated on Rose and Jack. In my opinion, if he did not do that mistake, this movie was going to be better than The Shawshank Redemption which is the best movie. I want to talk about the music. It was really awesome and what made it like this because he chose one of the best composers who is James Horner. Another strong point was its plot. It was organized correctly. the greatest thing in Titanic movie was its end. A protagonist who is Jack had died and he chose that to save his lover. It was the first time that I saw the end like this."
2013-11-02,k-kemi10,"Movie review Titanic is in my opinion an amazing movie. It exposes the true definition of love. Leonardo DiCario fearlessly takes on the leading role as Jack Dawson and in the end sacrifices his life for the woman he falls in love with. Titanic captivates the audience using agape love to connect with the audience and exciting real life situations for the audience to relate to. This movie shows Loves greatest attributes. Those attributes being sacrifice, youth, beauty, humbleness, and endlessness. The beginning of the movie allows the audience to get to know and understand the characters that play significant parts in the movie. Jack and Rose are casted as the leading actors and do a tremendous job in delivering the directors message with their skills. Yet, there are a few other important people that play imperative parts as well. Victor Garber (who plays Thomas Andrew), acts as the captain of the ship. He brilliantly portrays himself to be a dedicated, hardworking man that is emotionally connected to his ship as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The director sets the movie up chronologically but reverts to everything as a flashback, which is creative genius. Bernardo Bertolucci is the director of the film and directs this movie in such a way that the world now has a romantic novelty that can be used to show what true love looks like between a man and a woman throughout history, as well as defining true artistic and creative ideas that will forever have an effect of the audience that watches it. Leonardo DiCario and Kate Winslet (who plays rose Dewitt Bukater) have so much chemistry on the screen. The way those two connect is as if they have been passionately in love before in a past life. The climax of the movie is without a doubt the sinking of ship. From the time the ship hits the iceberg, until the time Jack drifts off to sea, action overtakes the movie and real life thrill pops out of the screen. As far as the directing during these scenes, the angles in which the camera records are very effective and essential to the overall perception of the movie. The way the camera zooms in behind and around Rose and Jack as they do the balcony scene, allows the audience to experience that very moment as well and examine how Rose and Jack's bodies reacted to each other the moment he knew he had fallen in love with her. The ending of the movie is where the audience pushes to the edge of their seats and grabs their tissues and the arm of whomever they came with. After seeing Jack sacrifice his life for the one person in the world he found to love more than anything, brings tears to even the men who watch. This is one of the most heartfelt profound films I've ever seen. It's jam packed with emotion, love, experience, knowledge, wisdom, hope, and action. That is the reason this movie is still a phenomenal hit in 2013. The Titanic is truly cinematic genius and is in my opinion one of the top three Romance movies of our time."

2013-10-14,CinemaClown,"One of the latest inquiries about this film's re-release was how it is in 3D. Pretty damn dazzling I would say. The details are more enriched, dark scenes are surprisingly crisp & clear and the entire experience is unforgettable. Re-mastered right from the ground up, In 3D, Titanic is a much more intimate experience. The visual effects are still better than most CGI films that comes out these days. Featuring epic depiction of disaster that very few movies can match, exceptional music by James Horner that today is easily one of the most recognizable scores, and last but not the least, James Cameron, who has always pushed the boundaries of technology in film-making to new levels, for crafting it with such care and dedication that it made the whole world fall in love with it, again. So take the journey, fall in love and experience Titanic, like never before."

2013-10-03,genstarzz,"Titanic was a big departure from the previous films director James Cameron had created. Films like The Terminator, Terminator 2, and Aliens are all sci-fi action CLASSICS and are some of my favorite movies. He had also directed True Lies, a solid action film, but not quite as intriguing, creative or original as the other films I mentioned. He also made The Abyss, which was enjoyable yet forgettable in my opinion. Overall, Cameron really shines and delivers when it comes to making Sci- fi action films that take themselves seriously.

Then Titanic came along. It was his first major film that was not science fiction nor action related. In a sense, Titanic tries to be to Cameron what Schindler's list was to Spielberg. This was Cameron's opportunity to show he had matured and can make a sophisticated film. A film based on a historical event without any elements of fantasy with great performances and emotional depth. Unfortunately, Titanic does not quite reach the levels of greatness that Schindler's list had.

Sad to say, after seeing this movie it is clear that Cameron isn't as versatile as Spielberg and should stick to a specific genre for best results. Not to say Titanic is awful. It is by no means a bad film, however it's not quite a classic because it suffers from being generic at times. Everything relating to the special effects, the sets, the costumes, etc. are not generic. They are all incredibly done and clearly overseen by a great director. What makes the movie generic are the things that separate it from Cameron's previous films: The love story.

If you took away all the thing mentioned above: the great sets, the great visual effects and so on and took everything away from the movie that had to do with the titanic, you would have nothing left but very cliché, by the book characters, plot and dialogue. Jack and Rose's relationship had nothing particularly new or innovative about it at all. Two people in love separated by social class is a story that's been told over and over again ever since Romeo and Juliet.

We've seen this story many times. This would be forgivable, if it wasn't for the fact that it's the core of the movie! Star Wars, in a way does something similar: it takes a story that everybody is familiar with and puts it in a bigger, larger than life setting. However, what gave Star Wars more of a punch than Titanic was that the characters were far more unique and memorable. Take Darth Vader for example and compare him to Caledon Hockley from Titanic. Cal is a character that we've seen in many silly high school comedies: the douche bag with a broom up his ass that we all want to see get his comeuppance at the end.

Darth Vader on the other hand, was nothing like any villain we've seen before and became a cultural icon. I'm not saying every character has to become a part of pop culture for the movie to be good, I'm just saying that that's what's keeping Titanic from being a masterpiece in my opinion. I will say, however, that the film is still really shines during certain parts. The sinking of the Titanic was emotional, yet jaw dropping to watch. The sets were also great, and although I think Jack and Rose might be a bit generic and even a little boring, they are still likable overall and it's sad when Jack dies at the end.

Overall, the movie is over rated, however I still consider it worth watching and entertaining. It's just destined to be compared with other films that reach a higher level of originality and storytelling because well, it's the second highest grossing film of all time. As far as Avatar is concerned, that film even suffers from generic storytelling even more than this one, and I feel that it's a bit of a shame that Cameron had clung to closely to cliché characters and plot lines"
2013-09-05,desert-jackets,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.

Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10."

2013-07-28,AbhiMathews,"Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event.

From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie.

I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see."

It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie.

Thanks Dean Scheu"

I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work.

This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them.

Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this."
2013-06-27,shollifield459,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time I can watch this movie over and over and over again it is that good. I doesn't even matter if I know what is gonna happen I love it anyways. I love the romance story behind it, it's so romantic. I want a man like Jack who will do anything to make sure I am OK with someone else or with him. If my boyfriend doesn't love this move I would be ready to kick his butt. Every guy can learn from this movie about what a girl really wants even if she says she doesn't want it. Every girl wants a guy they can tell everything to and not have to worry that he will tell anyone. Every girl wants a guy who can be himself in the weirdest situations. Ever girl wants to know that her boyfriend would give up his life for her no matter what happens. I hope every guy will give his future girlfriend or his girlfriend now all the respect she deserves. Cause every girl deserves a guy she can trust like a brother or a best guy friend cause they can have fun times in with all the bad times like I want to have a boyfriend like Jack he died to make sure Rose stayed alive and lived to go on he didn't even really try saving himself from the ice cold water. I love Jack and Rose if only they were able to live on together would be so much better"

2013-06-18,hitchcockthelegend,"It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.

You jump - I jump.

Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.

Never let go.

So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10"
2013-05-30,mauromuscio21,"This movie is one of those movies that when you look at it do not you forget it and will always remember him as one of the best movie you've ever seen the film as everyone knows speaks of the sinking of the Titanic, but James Cameron tries to make the lighter moment by telling the love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), an artist who lodges in the third class, and Rose (Kate Winslet), a seventeen year old girl from middle class family with a mother who has already planned a life and his wealthy fiancé Caledon ""Cal"" Hackley (Billy Zane). This film I've seen it many times and every time I feel an incredible feeling, it is precisely for this reason that Titanic is a masterpiece, because as many films do not ever get tired of seeing him always and every time you feel the same emotion as if it were the first time personally I can not even find a flaw in the film, I think the points that make a moving film Titanic and that leaves its mark are: the soundtrack by James Horner, the song My Heart Will Go On Celine Dion, dazzling special effects , photography Russell Carpenter and incredible interpretation of Kate Winslet. Unfortunately, the Cinema today has had many changes compared to what it once was, most of the movies they make today are trash films, Cinema today's needs instead of movies like Titanic, one of a kind and that will leave a mark in the heart and mind. Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1998 (all deserved): Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Special Effects, Best Original Score, Best Song, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Costume Design, I conclude saying that Titanic is a masterpiece and is one of the best films ever made."

2013-04-28,lisbonchicago,"I have unsuccessfully attempted to watch this film four times. At three hours and fourteen minutes, it feels like it is two movies in one. On the one hand, it is a history movie with great details about the ship, its crew and its passengers. On the other hand, it is also a love story, which feels like Romeo and Juliet on a boat, but with social class struggles instead of family feuding. As a history movie, Titanic is a top-20 film, but as a love story it falls flat for me. Call me heartless, but this movie did not affect me. I enjoyed DiCaprio and Winslet in the film, but I felt their roles weren't fully developed, because the film had two focuses. If the film would have focused on the love story alone, it could have been as powerful as The Notebook."
2013-04-26,Marc_Israel_365,"It isn't the romantic tale of rich girl-poor boy ingrained into many hearts due to Kate & Leo and it isn't the recreation of history with poetic license.... It's making me believe I'm seeing that ship sink every time I watch. Kudos to James Cameron, with a nod to the frightening Francis Fisher as the aristocratic Mother pimping out her daughter and Billy Zane whom without his sneer Titanic wouldn't have sailed so far. I'll put up with Leo calling out ""Rose, Rose"" another thousand times to again watch this disaster movie with the romantic hook. A Night To Remember tells the straight tale, but Titanic is certainly personalized with Camerons' storytelling."

2013-04-19,veynz1,"I am guilty. I am guilty of raving about this stupendously horrendous film initially. It took awhile to, well, 'sink' in.

History won't forgive James Cameron who had the nerve to take one of the biggest tragedies and reduce it to a sappy love story.

Just imagine yourself as one of the passengers on that ill-fated ship. Imagine the helplessness, the horror you experienced before drowning. Now imagine someone showing you this flick which makes it look like this disaster was all about a pair of stupid love-birds who thought they were at their charming best in a spitting contest.

God knows I'm sorry. We all should be."
2013-04-11,stephen7272,"Titanic is not what you think it is. You think it's a flimsy love story, about a skinny lad and a dumpy girl, set against the background of an historic event in 1912.

No, it's an experiment in mega-viewing. It's the Gone With The Wind of it's day. Both of them smashed box office records.

This movie is about getting bums on seats, just as GWTW was. So how did they do it? (I won't tell you because it's a global trade secret in human psychology.)

Nah, I'll tell you: it's the script! They did it by making every word, every line, of the script fail. At the beginning of the movie when you heard Di Caprio's friend say he was going to America (""L'AMERICA!!!""), you knew he would fail. When the owner of the liner said the ship was unsinkable, you knew those words would fail. When Billy Zane tried to bribe the crew member to get a seat on the lifeboat, you knew his words would fail.

Every line of the script (ok, not absolutely every line, but most of the main character lines) resulted in failure. That, ladies and gents, in a nutshell is how you make a blockbuster movie.

In GWTW, Scarlet says to Rett Butler, ""Where shall I go? What shall I do?"". He replies ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn."" Scarlet's words fail. In Titanic, Jacks final words to Rose as he dies of cold are ""Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me."" Err...that's nonsense. He's dying. He even jokes ""I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this."" Err..fail.

If you want to know more, and there is more, just send a blank check to....me."
2013-04-09,biancasfilms,"I love this movie so much. I remember watching Titanic when I was 8 and i cried so much. James Cameron did a perfect job just seeing how much effort he put into this film is crazy. Like who has this kind of mind to think a perfect plot, relating to our history. Its just too amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was damn. Not just his looks but his acting was too perfect, his depth, his love for Rose is just every girl's dream. The other actors did amazing, Billy Zane so believable, including Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, and Kathy Bates. And of course Kate Winslet, was just so beautiful and so likable in this movie.

This movie shows that anyone can love, it doesn't matter what you do or who you are."
2013-04-08,benfield-larry09,"James Cameron re-invents the epic big cast disaster films of the 70's with grand style. To begin with as a Titanic buff since my early childhood I was astonished the first time I saw this film. The extreme accuracy and detail of the ship is extraordinary. The original shipbuilding firm Harland and Wolff participated in the construction of the sets and models used in the film. When you see this film you are seeing the Titanic as it was on sailing day.

As for the story, both Dicaprio and Winslet provide excellent performances as Jack and Rose. Their star crossed story is deeply interwoven in the Titanic mythology that is both fact and legend. Through their experiences we are allowed to explore the Titanic in ways never presented on film. Many of the ship's iconic locations are seen in the film and the recent Blu-ray edition brings the film into glorious high definition 1080hd format.

Cameron's excellent use of lighting, camera angles and visual effects allow us to feel almost there both visually and emotionally during the final phases of the film that come close in timing to the actual sinking. The film leaves us both sad and hopeful at the same time and few films provide us with such dual emotions.

If you like love stories, this film is for you, if you have any interest in the Titanic or disaster movies then the film will appeal to those audiences as well. Most importantly it is a entertaining ride by one of the best film makers of this generation and I recommend anyone to give the film a try and judge for yourself."
2013-03-30,MartinHafer,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.

I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once."

2013-03-01,illbebackreviews,"All these years I've never wanted to sit down and watch this movie for various reasons. Yesterday, I just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie, expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie. I was pleasantly surprised and blown away.

As a person whose only ever seen Cameron's big three: T2, Aliens and Terminator, I never thought that any movie could ever near those three films. I have yet to see 'Avatar' which I will sometime but back to topic- Titanic blew me away as I had such low expectations.

Everyone knows the story of 'Titanic', where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love. As time goes by, Titanic crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger. Everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 Oscars, the most that is only tied with 'Return of the King' and 'Ben-hur'.

There is so much that I love about 'Titanic' that I don't like in most romance movies. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The acting is great, the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping, the visuals are amazing, the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity. The characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful. Cameron's writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as 'I'm flying!' My main concern with Titanic before watching it was that I believed that Cameron wouldn't be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies: T2, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss, True Lies etc. He proved me wrong and I only love Cameron more for this! He has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie To conclude this review here, 'Titanic' is an awesome, beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, with amazing visuals, a huge scope, amazing music and some great characters. The movie itself doesn't deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 Oscars it got but 'Titanic' is still....An amazing movie that everyone needs to check out!"

Jack did every thing he could have done, to save his love. He made her believe she would be safe & nothing would happen to her as long He was by her side & sadly in the end sacrificed himself for Rose. Nothing could have been any sadder than that . .

Jack made us Realize that After all, 'Love is all about Sacrifice'. When u love someone to that extent you don't even care about yourself, even if u freeze to death . .

2012-12-07,msztyfbpjb,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic.Randy Welsh The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.

Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy Randy Welsh characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she Randy Welsh felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""

Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to Randy Welsh be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats."

Every scene from ""Titanic"" from start to finish is fantastic; the love scenes to the final moments. You'll find yourself getting way into the plot, as well as feeling for the characters.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Jack and Rose. Once they enter the picture, you cannot help but love any moment they spend together, and their ""forbidden"" romance is so emotional and powerful.

The ship's final moments will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as shock you. James Cameron does an excellent job of recreating the sinking. It's hard to imagine that a horrible incident like this happened 100 years ago. Cameron marvels at bringing the disaster to life.

On the whole, ""Titanic"" is a wonderful movie. Nothing can describe the sheer greatness coming out of it. If you haven't seen it, I strongly suggest you give it a try.

2012-10-29,rannynm,"Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-ray3D and digital, didn't completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 – it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes! Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter. Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar- winning Best Sound. Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a ""romantic masterpiece."" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, "" even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up."" On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available.

Titanic

Reviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!"

2012-10-13,Hotwok2013,"One harsh film critic memorably called this film, in his opinion, ""A wet blanket"". In my personal opinion James Cameron's ""Titanic"" at the very least borders on a great film. A great love story is intertwined into the tragedy of this longish, but never boring, film. All in all it is not only an excellently entertaining film but probably both Kate Winslet & Leonardo DeCaprio's finest hour. Whether or not a rich high-society woman would be capable of falling in love with a poor steerage passenger, (who won the money to buy his ticket playing poker), in real life is debatable, but I was able to suspend my disbelief. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a young man called Jack Dawson who is an aspiring artist & is excellent. Although from a working-class background he is worldly-wise & has been around. He meets Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet) after he saves her life when she attempts to commit suicide. She is intended (mainly at her mother's insistence) to marry a man named Cal Hockley played by Billy Zane. Rose doesn't really love him & things have started to get on top of her. Mr. Hockley is rich but such an upper-class scumbag that you cannot really blame Rose for contemplating topping herself!. The courtship on board the ship between Rose & Jack is great & often done to the haunting theme music in the background which adds to the romance. The cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely beautiful & is probably the single best factor of the entire movie. The filming of the ship striking an iceberg & eventually sinking is particularly well done. My final comment concerns the closing credits as Celine Dion sings ""My Heart Will Go On"". Everybody, it seems, from the films smallest bit-player extras down to Mr. Cameron's tea lady gets a mention in the credits which really do go on & on & on! The number of people listed, but not credited, in the cast list is utterly astounding & I couldn't help wondering what, (if anything?), they were paid."

We can find love (that's the main theme), action (the sinking ship), a little story of friendship (Jack and his buddy), religious moments, beautiful scenery, and many values.

This is a multi-layered movie of which people can see from different views. I'd like to say that this one of most Oscar winning movies is full of values through which people can learn more about life. It won't be boring to watch it over and over again, and even when we watch for the 10th times, we still can get something new from the movie, either new moral message we just notice that moment or a scene we've possibly forgotten.

Through this one of highest grossed movies of all time, I get Leo as my most favourite actor.

I've watched it 12 times and still plan to watch it again, sooner or later. Thank God for this movie..."

2012-10-03,lasttimeisaw,"To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.

To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell).

The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot.

To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives."
2012-09-30,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Back at the 90s when I was a little child, I loved all of the films that came out at the time, but I never heard of James Cameron before until at 2009, when that guy made his sci-fi epic ""Avatar"", I saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite it's flawed story (loved the concept, by the way) and considered one of the best movies James Cameron has ever made since the first two Terminator movies (I've watched them and I thought they were completely epic) and Aliens. So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.

Before I could get to the positive aspects, I've heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they're outweighed by it's redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it's cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.

The direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.

Overall, Titanic isn't nearly as excellent as James Cameron's previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me."
2012-09-26,dspek16,"This is truly one of my favorite movies of all time. With a amazing cast of wonderful actors, great dialogue, and an unforgettable plot. This movie ties with The Abyss as the greatest James Cameron movie. I mean don't get me wrong Avatar is a great movie with a good plot and unbelievably spectacular special effects and CGI, but unlike Titanic, I can't watch it over and over again like Titanic or The Abyss.

This is a movie of epic proportions, and knowing quite a bit about the real Titanic, quite historically accurate. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have great chemistry and are perfect for their roles. The rest of the cast including Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Jonathan Hyde and Victor Garber make it almost perfect. This is and amazing film about one of the most tragic accidents in history that has made it's mark in film history and should be viewed by everyone. 10/10"
2012-09-15,wildandcrazguy1,"I know it's been over 10 years since this movie but I recently watched this on blu-ray and just felt like reviewing ""Titanic."" I am not really a big James Cameron fan, I only like three of his works. But, ""Titanic"" is his masterpiece. He takes the tragedy of the ship and puts a love story spin on it. I like this aspect of it, especially when you know what the outcome of Titanic is. The viewer gets the happy feeling of Jack and Rose falling in love and the entire time you are wondering how things are going to turn out for these two. The way this movie is shot is nothing short of perfect. The destruction of the ship, the chaos that ensued and how the people felt both on and off the ship. It makes the viewer feel like they are there and can feel how the passengers felt. ""Titanic"" invokes every human emotion and that is really rare in movies today. James Cameron was able to do the impossible with this project and carried away 11 Oscars. Simply extraordinary. ""Titanic"" has been loved and enjoyed for nearly 15 years and will continue to be loved and enjoyed for many more."
2012-09-14,pac614,"I watched this movie tonight in the Blu-ray 3-D version! I thought it was a wonderful movie! I have seen the original version at the theater and have watched it several times on TV. I think it is one of the most heart wrenching movies I have ever seen. I loved the music, the actors, and the story-line. The 3-D version is the BEST in my opinion.

I ordered the 3-D version from AMAZON several weeks ago and waited impatiently for it in the mail. When it arrived today I could hardly wait to watch it on my 3-D TV!

I thought Kate Winslet, Leonard DiCaprio and others did an amazing job.

I looked at the era this was set in and thought about my own Dad who would have been in his mid-20's at that time and how a catastrophe like the sinking of a ship like the Titanic might have affected the people of that era.

Great movie!"
2012-09-13,Hojangs,"A film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema. 'Titanic,' was recently re-released on Blu-Ray, and I took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade. I was 8 years old when I last saw this film, something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was over-long, soppy and incredibly dull. How wrong I was.

'Titanic,' is epic cinema at its finest. So many aspects of the film are truly wonderful, the scale, the performances and the design to name a few. James Cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works. Though the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 serves as the basis for this film, the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society; Jack Dawson, played by a boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class drifter with a gift for art, and Rose, a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement, portrayed by a fresh-faced Kate Winslet. Over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so many.

The true wonder of 'Titanic,' is its sheer scale. The film was originally released in 1997, yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of today's Hollywood. The costume design and set production is absolutely staggering, truly worthy of the Oscars the design and production won. The special effects are also worth praising, especially considering that the film is now 15 years old. However, with the transition to Blu-Ray, and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer, some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious, though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience. The sound design is also excellent, particular praise reserved for the score. There is an almost Enya-like quality to the score, gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct places.

The performances are all excellent. DiCaprio and Winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders, and do so with aplomb. Their chemistry is impressive, and both actors are pleasant and likable. Billy Zane, as Rose's arrogant fiancé, is suitably horrid and despicable, and Zane gives probably the best performance of his career. All roles are performed well, including Kathy Bates as a 'new-money,' socialite and Bernard Hill as the captain of the doomed voyage.

There are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered, and there's a reason. 'Titanic,' is an incredible experience, and well worth picking up on Blu-Ray. I'm certainly glad I did."

2012-07-26,Jennastep426,"I couldn't take my eyes off this movie once I started to watch. It was the most well thought out,original one of a kind masterpiece i have ever laid eyes on. Just thinking about it could make me cry. Even if you haven't seen the movie in full, almost no one hasn't heard one reference in a show movie.. etc etc. There is just no way to avoid it ! This was the most expensive film made at the time, and it was money well spent.Now it is on the top 5 grossing movie of all time list. Director James Cameron is as good as they come, and will be remembered 100 years from now as the director of ""Titanic"". Kate Winslet is the perfect actress for this role and has the old rich charm that upper class people had back then. Leonardo DiCaprio became my crush of the century !! He is so caring and sweet and beautiful!! Go watch this movie!

Note: To people who say its cheesy your missing out!"
2012-07-13,eagleeyedcritic,"This movie was WAY too long and drawn out.

The romance was sappy and creepy to me as Leonard Dicaprio looks like a young boy (so I don't understand why women would go to see this for him) whereas Kate Winslett (who's acting I normally think is great) looks much, much older.

Additionally, I saw the Poseidon Adventure (1972 movie on similar topic of ship sinking) and it was way better with way better acting.

This movie, Titanic was so predictable - I would have left the theatre if it wasn't for the person I was with that was loving the movie who dragged me there.

Really over-hyped."
2012-07-11,byrann_gowan,"This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.

The story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal's and her mother's hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.

James Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You've done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.

I must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.

However, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.

Overall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it. The dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle, but the actors are great, the story is great, the direction is great, etc. Overall, a 10/10 for me."
2012-07-06,werefox08,"Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here...."
2012-07-02,Kane20,"James Cameron's Titanic is proof that a movie doesn't have to be original to be good. I'm not saying that originality is bad; I like it, it's good, but it's a minor factor in how good a movie/story is. The story doesn't necessarily have to be original, but it has to be compelling to people; has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout. Titanic does just that. It captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end (it did for many people, anyway, including me).

Titanic combines fiction with non-fiction, the more important of which is probably the non- fiction aspect: the tragic sinking of the luxury cruiser R. M. S. Titanic in 1912. There have been a few films that portrayed the tragic event (such as Titanic in 1953 and A Night To Remember in 1958). Then, in 1997, along came James Cameron, who, despite some weaknesses with script and dialogue, is good at storytelling, and always pushes the advancement of visual and special effects, and uses them to his advantage. Therefore, a film about the Titanic was a perfect project for him. The recreation of the ship is great, with excellent detail and scope. Except for a few brief moments here and there when something doesn't look quite real, it's it looks spellbindingly realistic, and, while watching it, it felt almost like I was really there. James Cameron really spent his $200 million budget wisely.

Some of that money also went into filming some footage of the actual wreck at the bottom of the ocean. This footage is seen in a scene at the beginning of the movie, shot via a remote- controlled underwater camera. As Roger Ebert says, ""These shots strike precisely the right note; the ship calls from its grave for its story to be told."" However, instead of only telling a story of only the real event, he also weaves a fictional story ingeniously into it, specifically an almost Romeo and Juliet-like story of forbidden love. In modern times (actually, during the time the film was made), a fictitious survivor of the Titanic sinking, old Rose DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart), tells the story via flashback, and tells about her brief yet intense forbidden love affair with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).

Seventeen-year-old Rose (Kate Winslett), from a wealthy upper-class background, is betrothed to a rich snob, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). She hates this, and is extremely miserable. Meanwhile, Jack is basically poor, and he wins a ticket to the Titanic in a lucky win in a card game. He eventually finds Rose, who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship, and he saves her life. What follows is the development of their forbidden love story, which is told in such a way that shows off different parts of the magnificent cruise ship. It's a simple, predictable, and clichéd story, but it's still very compelling, especially since we know how that the ship is going to sink eventually and cause heartbreaking results on their romance (predictability is actually good here).

Meanwhile, there is the subplot regarding the actual historical events leading up to the sinking - the arrogance of the builders and the people who ran the ship (they thought the ship was unsinkable). At the midpoint of the movie, the ship hits the iceberg, and the second half of the movie begins, and develops into a thrilling yet tense and dramatic race for survival. The entire movie, from start to finish, is handled extremely well in terms of story, and is completely full of heart and soul; it's all very strong in emotion. And yes, it's predictable, but in this case it actually adds to the power of the movie. But it's not completely predictable. There are a lot of things that are not fully given away, like exactly who dies (besides Jack) and who lives (besides Rose), and some other things along the way, too.

Some people would definitely argue that the love story between Jack and Rose is completely unnecessary, but it actually helps the movie. It adds more emotion to the story and makes it that much more compelling. It also provides more structure to the story and the showing-off of the ship, and even allows the audience to really connect with the passengers on the ship (innocent people whose lives are ultimately ruined or permanently altered as a result of the builders' arrogance and ignorance – unsinkable, yeah right). And the special effects also made the film work well, too. However, despite having great special effects in his film, James Cameron did not lose sight of what's truly important – story, characters, emotion, etc. The movie does not rely on special effects. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well without them, but they are not the main driving force of the film.

If I had to criticize one thing about the film, it would be the length. In my opinion, it's too long, at three hours and fifteen minutes. However, it still works brilliantly as it is. Every moment of the story serves a great and important contribution to the story, the drama, the emotion, and everything else. The performances by the actors were very good, the pacing of the film is great (if a bit lengthy at times), and the tone of the film is great. James Horner's score is fantastic, very memorable, absolutely beautiful, and perfect for the film. And, despite having a good deal of fiction in it, the movie excellently portrays the historical tragic sinking of the Titanic, and captures the horror and tragedy brilliantly. With lots of heart, suspense, drama, and great historical portrayal combined with fiction and stunningly realistic visual and special effects, James Cameron's Titanic is arguably the best film of 1997.

My Rating: **** (out of ****)

2012-06-13,a-orourke-292-969653,"I found the movie very good. I really enjoyed it! James Cameron made a fantastic film! Apparently Titanic is already a very big success around the world and has won 11 Oscars! Quite a lot! I saw the Titanic movie three times already. The actors played brilliantly and Titanic has one of the best pictures I've ever seen. It was very succeeded! Titanic has a very good music, best costumes, best decoration, best story... It is one of the best film I've seen in my life!!! It was very emotional like film and very beautiful, charming and sad at the same time. The end made me cry in my head. It was so well done! I can't believe that Titanic is such a popular movie! The only thing I didn't like was that the film was TOO LONG!!! Actually, I didn't really mind. It is a very dramatic story. The music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot! The music described very well what was happening in the film and the character's feelings!!! Really enjoyable!!! James Cameron is a true genius. I haven't seen Titanic in 3D but I hope that the 3D was excellent. It was a very good story of love! I could recommend it to little and great children to see it! They might love it! The ship was pretty and wonderfully made!!! Pictures are really amazing. Titanic isn't really the ""kind"" of film that I prefer the most but now I realized how good it was! My name is Constantin and I am fourteen. Thank you very much and goodbye!"
2012-06-06,KineticSeoul,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.

7.9/10"
2012-06-06,intern-88,"The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.

Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.

I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.

Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.

The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.

Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fiancé Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.

Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.

I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience"
2012-06-02,LeonLouisRicci,"""there are only lifeboats for half the people... yea the better half"".

The segregation, oppression, and unenlightened separation of the privileged few from the unkempt, unwashed masses is the ""dramatic"" thread that seems to be the ""soul"" of this bloated, overwritten, orally deficient melodrama. It is completely counterpointed by the very last scene. An antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makers.

It is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, incomprehensible, and downright selfish. One wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that mega-million dollar necklace. All for a cheap sentimental tug.

Some interesting special effects, attractive people, and unintentional humor are not enough to redeem this unforgivable, utter failure of a film that can only be subjugated to the lower decks of American Cinema."
2012-05-29,loopmyworld,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.

The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too.

The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie.

There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray.

True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern.

On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.

The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.

My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!"
2012-05-25,ramsa-377-413193,"After I have done my research about the Titanic all I can say is watching a movie is a story and knowing how it was made and the effort, ideas, techniques, and technologies that was involved in making the movie is completely another story.

I was amazed when I read that in order for James Cameron to shoot the scene of the real Titanic under the water he built a miniature that replicates how the ship looks like under the water. The reason the miniature was built was to guide James Cameron while shooting under the water even though some scenes of the miniature was used in the film. Since shooting the real Titanic was done using a submarine, it was hard for James Cameron to move the cameras to get the angles he wanted and it required to move the submarine in ways that it was not capable of doing. So they had to attach movable cameras to the body of the submarine which in turn reduced the total available shooting time because of the pressure on the cameras. So, they had to train everybody who was involved in this shot including the submarine operators using the miniature to utilize the shooting time under the ocean."

2012-05-14,achraj,"I saw this movie again and again & noticed more and more dedication and love for this movie..

Titanic's central aspect is the love story between Jack and Rose, and the crush it has on Cal. The romantic story isn't original, but this is not a bad thing. Cameron re-invents the story to fit the time period and its characters. Everything fits perfectly, with nothing ever seeming contrived or awkward. Jack's immediate interest in Rose, and Rose likewise, is completely understandable. She is suffering emotionally, and Jack is there to support her. Themes from Romeo and Juliet are included, such as Rose being an upper-classman, and Jack being lower class. But the emotional connection between Rose and Jack is almost palpable, and this fuels the film's first two hours. We watch the trials of Jack and Rose, and as they overcome them, the ship comes closer to destiny. With a ship as large as the Titanic was, it was destined to crash. And of course, the ship isn't stocked with enough lifeboats to accommodate the 2,200 passengers. In the end, over 700 people survive, while the rest drown, freeze, or commit suicide.

The resolution of the film, after the ship's gone under, is just as powerful as anything else in the movie. It ends rather surprisingly, with a touching symbolic conclusion. Most films end predictably, or inappropriately, but Titanic ends just on the right note. In fact, the symbolism of the final scene is so perfect, that many people will contemplate over the meaning for months. The film does end rather depressingly, and unexpectedly, but when you think about it, it couldn't have ended any other way. All the questions are answered, and we are left with a weak smile due to the intense situation we were just put through. The Titanic sinking is an emotional roller coaster, with many more realistic deaths than any Independence Day. The death scenes are so realistic, that you find yourself caring for every single passenger. Cameron never compromises the integrity of his film, and the deaths of the passengers is never overemphasized. He doesn't linger on each death, but takes it as it comes to show us the realism without trying to force emotions out of the audience. But emotions do show, and almost anyone will find themselves wiping away a few tears.

Hats off for this masterpiece..!"

2012-05-05,johncairns-354-682933,"Couldn't help but notice the number of posters that feel criticizing the movie-in any way-lumps you into a group of social misfits described as 'haters'. I thought the movie was fairly entertaining with outstanding special effects, but had a large problem with the lack of realism, especially ironic as Cameron 'got' most of the details correctly.

The 'love story' was patently ludicrous, but probably the thing that drove the numbers at the box office, the treatment of historical figures like 'Molly' Brown-for example-was appalling, dripping with misogyny.

With a little more even handed treatment the movie could have been outstanding and compelling to the degree that it actually deserved the Oscars it won that year, and still included a plausible romantic plot."
2012-05-04,gregjudy-1,"The movie ""Titanic"", written, directed, and produced by James Cameron centers on the sinking of the RMS Titanic, while also focusing on a fictitious love story between two forbidden loves.

Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a 17 year-old first class passenger who is engaged to be married to Pittsburgh steel magnate Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Although she says she loves Cal, Rose feels pressured by her mother (Frances Fisher) into marrying him. Rose's mother acknowledges the fact that the marriage is a way to solve the family's secret financial problems. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who wins a ticket aboard the Titanic in a poker match. Rose first meets Jack when he saves her from throwing herself overboard in an act of suicide. This rapidly starts a love affair between the two.

A common theme in this movie is the contrasting differences between the first and third class passengers. The first class passengers are made to appear ignorant, arrogant, and self-centered, while the third class passengers are kind, charitable, and altruistic. While this may have been true of some first class passengers, others were very generous, giving up their seat on the lifeboat for those who needed it. I feel that the story played too much into the greed of the upper-class.

This movie is a good movie in many ways. The direction, music, production, camera-work, and set creation are especially good, as is the acting by Kate Winslet. However, I was not very pleased with the work of the other actors/actresses, especially that of Gloria Stuart, who received an Academy Award nomination for her role as an elderly Rose. Her acting was cheesy and mediocre, yet she earned a nomination due to the hype surrounding the film at the time of its release. The screenplay was also lacking. Although the dialogue is pretty good, the lines are unbelievably predictable and corny. I expected better from a James Cameron film.

Overall, I guess I had extremely high expectations going into this movie (wouldn't anyone?), and my hopes were dashed by bad acting and writing."

2012-05-02,WinstonNoCGI,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.

It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.

After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.

Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.

This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.

We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.

To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there."
2012-04-30,Edd-N-Furter,"When Titanic was released for the first time back in 1997 it became a cultural phenomenon: for 12 years it was the highest grossing film in history, winner of 11 Academy Awards, turned Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet into huge movie stars and made My heart will go on sung by Celine Dion a romantic anthem.

However, with the passing of the years being a fan of Titanic became the equivalent of having bad taste and poor judgment in films. I personally disagree with this highly subjective assessment, since Titanic is the best example of how to make a sweeping epic like those that used to be made in Hollywood's golden age.

Thus, James Cameron uses the tragic sinking of the ship that ""not even God could sink"" to tell the already iconic love story between Rose DeWitt Bukater, the American girl betrothed to a steel tycoon whom does not love and Jack Dawson, the aspiring artist who has traveled the world in search of his identity becomes a desperate struggle to survive once the ship hits an iceberg and is destined to sink. This aspect of the movie has always been criticized, as Cameron chooses to tell a fictional story instead of focusing on one of the many true stories of the passengers; this is a risky decision that pays off due to Cameron's ability to associate reality and fiction respecting the historical perspective, the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet and the unexpected sensitivity with which Cameron tells a love story (something unusual for him, given his previous experience in science fiction movies), it could even be said that without Jack and Rose the film wouldn't have had the same impact and success.

This does not diminish at all the impressive historical recreation not only of the Titanic (for which an almost exact replica of the original boat had to build), but the period in general, and this is not limited to costumes and scenery, but also in the notes on the differences between social classes existing in the early twentieth century and decadence disguised as opulence, which unfortunately have not changed much today.

The sinking of the Titanic has been told numerous times in film and on TV, but James Cameron's version has become the obligatory reference, not only for the reasons already mentioned, but also for the incredible realism and technical accuracy this is portrayed achieving really shocking moments and scenes of high emotional impact that are not quite successful on other versions and that make us partakers of such tragedy as if we were watching it live. This is due to the use Cameron makes of digital technology without being overwhelmed by it, since he understands that digital effects must serve the story and not vice versa.

Special mention to the brief but poignant appearance of Gloria Stuart as old Rose, who serves as the narrator of the story, and gives consistency to the story as well gives it humanity and warmth.

Titanic has not only withstood the test of time but also the unflattering trials of those who call themselves connoisseurs of good cinema and remains one of the greatest epic films ever made."
2012-04-30,citizensatan,
2012-04-30,pingshar,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!! I loved how Cameron put a fictional story to have a tie-in with the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic sinking. .

The acting from all those in it is superb. Billy Zane plays Cal brilliantly, Leo Di Caprio is one of the greatest actors in the world, and who better to play rose than Kate Winslet!? All in all this film is a must see, again and again and again!! I watch Titanic at least once a week, and twice on Sunday. Titanic never ceases to amaaaaze!!!

You say there are other good movies out there!? I don't think so!!!

Some people like Lawrence of Arabia, but I think it is far too dry. Who wants to watch a movie set in a desert!? It would have been much better if they had attacked Damascus from the sea!! Pass the beer!

I liked the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind, and the score was pretty good, but there were no words. What this film needs is a theme song. And a HOT love scene!! This is a romance, Margaret!!!

Now Casablanca is a film with a good theme song. But there's not much of a plot. Can anyone remember the point of this movie!? It just meanders along like no one knew what the ending was going to be.

What's with that long bus ride in It Happened One Night? And then all we get to see is Clark Gable taking off his shirt? Boring!!

All The President's Men has some strong performances by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, but the guy who plays Richard Nixon doesn't look anything like him. The President was kind, the President was understanding, and the President was smart, too smart to get caught up bugging the Democrat Headquarters. Totally unbelievable storyline!!

The Wizard of Oz has some nice singing by Judy Garland, but the CGI is pretty weak. Those muchkins don't look realistic, at all!!

My Fair Lady has some good music, but the sets and costumes are pretty pathetic. Didn't look like London, at all. Looked more like Disneyland.

Rebecca has a pretty good plot and a nice fire. But they seemed to have left out one little tiny detail. What was the name of his second wife?! Sloppy writing, Daphne!!

North Buy Northwest has some amusing chase scenes and some clever dialog, but it is soooo predictable. Totally lacking in suspense.

OK, Psycho has some suspense, even if it is short on dialog, but it is so flat. Now this is a film that needs to be redone in 3D!!

Das Boot is long and boring. Sure, it is realistic, and life aboard a submarine IS boring. But it needs some excitement. Maybe they could steal an Enigma machine back from the British, or discover an underwater Atlantis or hit an iceberg or something, anything, to relieve the monotony. I know! Maybe they could dive through a wormhole and accidentally shoot a torpedo into the Titanic, or better yet, the Californian!!

So there you have it. Titanic is without doubt the greatest masterpiece of cinema ever made. Period!!!!"
2012-04-29,tavm,"Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Will Go On"" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron's Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn't really necessary IMHO."
2012-04-28,raulfaust,
2012-04-27,marc-387,"Much of the 3D conversion in the earlier part of the film looked phony and actually detracted from the story. The images looked like multiple 2D layers pasted at different distances and each layer looked flat and lacked depth, making for an incongruous and distracting image, unlike a film shot with a twin lens camera to begin with.

Later scenes, shot at greater distances where the 3D effect was more subtle, were more effective and sometimes quite stunning.

(Note, review policy demands that I have at least ten lines of text. I didn't want to repeat any of the previous comments about this movie, there are over 2000 messages, good and bad, about the story. All I needed to say was in the first eight lines. Anyway, IMDb now you have your ten lines.)"

2012-04-19,Anurag-Shetty,"Titanic, is a fictional take on the tragic maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds & how they overcome all odds to be together. Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who boarded the Titanic by chance. It was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the Titanic at stake. Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) is a woman of the royal family. She is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the Titanic, along with other famous, wealthy & important people. So it was fate & fate alone, that brought Jack & Rose together. This is the synopsis of the movie.

This is my review of the new 3D version of Titanic that released in 2012. First off, what a beautiful story. Sure, it's predictable, but, the way in which it's written ensures that you don't get bored even for a single second. The way that Jack & Rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet share great chemistry together. Not to mention, that they've acted brilliantly! Both Oscar worthy performances. Unfortunately, only Kate Winslet won the award for best actress. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The way they've shown how the ship first hits the iceberg, starts flooding, tilts at a 180 degree angle & finally snaps into two makes the movie. All this looks even better in 3D! The best conversion from 2D to 3D ever! So, grab your 3D glasses, popcorn & soft drink & be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again! James Cameron, take a bow! A must watch!"

2012-04-16,ketgup83,"Titanic was a heart-warming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident. A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages. Watching it again after 14 years in 3D is liking icing on the cake. A masterpiece in deed !!"

2012-04-15,iloveUGA123,"This movie in my opinion deserves nothing less than 8 stars because it is such a masterpiece. It definitely showed the tragedy of the Titanic because the whole sinking of the Titanic in the movie was done in such detail that you really learned and could feel how tragic it was! For most men to come on here and write bad reviews about this movie, just don't, because the romance between Jack and Rose was for girls and to make the movie a romantic tragedy. Making it a romantic tragedy made the movie more sad so we could feel even more how much of a tragedy it was! Men obviously don't like romance like that, but the way the did the sinking scene was fabulous! I am a girl so I loved the romance between Jack and Rose, and I think that it truly added more to the movie, because you have to have a story line for a movie that you don't want to make a documentary. The story line was amazing because back then everything was about if you are 1st class, 2nd class, or 3rd class, and you could really see how the 3rd class people were treated compared to the 1st class people because Jack was a very, very poor 3rd class man, and Rose was a 1st class woman engaged to such a wealthy man. If you are a guy you won't really like the romance story line, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. If you are a girl I would definitely recommend watching this movie! I did cry, A LOT! So be prepared if you are someone who does cry during movies!"

**** (out of 4)

James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.

The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.

Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.

I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level."
2012-04-14,o_anonymous_j,"Well nothing much as a review that i could write about the movie, as i was too small too watch it the first time it released in 1997. When I first saw this movie, I was aboard a Cruise liner in Asia pacific with my friends and fell in love with it completely. I must say that we did try all the stunts in the movie on the cruise as well. ;) When the movie released in 3D, I could not give it a miss at all. The drama and the story grips you completely when you watch it in a theatre. You get sucked into the movie right from the scene when older rose starts with her story of titanic. The sound and scenes makes the movie a memorable one. no wonder it won 11 Oscars.

Thank you Mr. Cameron for the wonderful experience in 3D."
2012-04-14,ccsandesq,"Titanic never ceases to amaze The acting is incredible. The scenery breathtaking. The special effects, especially how Titanic fades into life from a hulking wreck. Nevertheless, it's a difficult film to watch with such catastrophic and tragic loss of life. Unlike Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams, I do not think that 3D really adds anything to the film. So much so, that I barely noticed it at all, except perhaps for the first few scenes. (Except, perhaps, that it got people into movie theatres a second time.) Only one scene in the film has been changed: the star field that Rose looks up at while floating on the driftwood has been altered to reflect the correct view for that date and time."
2012-04-12,duraflex,"James Cameron really knows how to tell a story and make an amazing movie.

This film holds up brilliantly 15 years after its initial release. The new 3-D version is fantastic - especially the shots of the ship. The underwater scenes are stunning. It is all done masterfully.

How they go back and remake a live action film into 3-D is a mystery to me but the magic works.

In recent years, I choose to see most films on DVD or Blu-Ray, but this one was worth a trip to the theater. I never left my seat once.

Seeing the film again since the real life passing of Gloria Stuart (old Rose) and seeing it on the 100th anniversary of Titanic's one and only sailing made it that much more poignant."
2012-04-12,plasticbippy,"Titanic is a sad movie and a love story.

I liked the move because it's realistic (it's based on a true story).

In the beginning of the movie there are some documentaries added, you can hear the real Rose telling us about the accident.

There are also very good actors in the movie.

The negative with the movie is that they faked with Jack (he didn't exist in real life). They tricked me!

It was based on a true story, it was a good love story and it was realistic. The actors were also excellent. It was in some scenes very touching."
2012-04-10,HollywoodVixen90,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time!! I first saw this movie in theaters when it first came out in 1997. I was just 7 at the time but I fell in love with this movie, the characters, and the story of Titanic itself. I remember seeing this movie once with my mom and dad, and then my mom and I loved it so much that we went to go see it for a second time.

I just recently saw this movie again last week as it was being re-released in 3D. I never thought I would see this movie in the theaters again, but I'm glad I got the chance to see this movie again on the big screen and better yet, in 3D as well.

This is such a tragic love story, I can't help but cry every time I watch it. It's just such a sad story and I'm pretty sure it will always get to me. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were perfectly cast as ""Jack and Rose"". Billy Zane was also an excellent choice for the evil ""Cal"".

I'm 21 years old and I know ""Titanic"" is going to be considered a classic in the years to come.

I don't know why some people wouldn't like this movie, I think they're insane. This movie introduced me to the true story of a horrific event that I had personally never heard of before seeing the movie. Ever since I've seen the movie, I've become interested in the history of the ""Titanic"", and I love learning as much as I can about this historic event.

I'm a huge movie person, but I have to say this is probably my favorite love story. ""Titanic"" holds a special place in my heart and it always will. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest films ever made!!!

For you music buffs out there, the score for this film is absolutely beautiful and I highly recommend you listen to the soundtrack."

2012-04-10,wandijoe75,It's a pretty good movie all around. The story line is interesting and draws you in and make you think. I love all the music and the actors as well. The movie is just a little too long but still one of the best movies of all time. 20 years from now it will still be worth seeing and still a tear jerker. No one should miss seeing this movie. It makes you want to know more about the Titanic and what happen all those years ago. It's a lesson teacher in so many ways not just a love story. If you miss it then you have missed a Winner.I can't see why anyone wouldn't want to see this movie. It's far from boring. Just imagine that's you or your love one on that ship and what would you do? Would you be able to handle it? As I stated the only downer was the time it was a little too long for my liking.
2012-04-10,sasikanth20,"Now how does one rate a classic like Titanic?? I was 11 years old when the movie first released and I still remember the first time I went to watch it. I barely had any knowledge about movies back then, but the sheer grandeur and brilliance of this movie made me watch it a billion times over and over!! (Twice in the last five days in 3D!!)

After working on action classics like The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and True Lies, James Cameron comes up with one of the best romantic, epic movies of all times. The way he adds fiction to the true story is absolutely brilliant. The script is too long, dialogues a little cheesy, screenplay a tad slow, but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie. Bottom line, I'm no one to talk about this man.

Twenty-two year old Kate Winslet looks gorgeous as Rose DeWitt Bukate, and plays her role to perfection. Her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that I have goosebumps even now thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as Jack Dawson is one of his best works to date. The chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see on-screen. The rest of the cast, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and every other actor, is excellent. It's a shame that it didn't win any Oscars for acting!

Cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely splendid. The way he captured the romantic moments between Rose and Jack in the first half, and the disastrous sinking in the later half is terrific. It is one of the best work on cinematography I've seen to date. Editing by James Cameron, Conrad Buff IV and Richard A. Harris is perfect. Music by James Horner is absolutely brilliant. Be it the foot tapping Irish music for the real party under-decks, the musicians playing till the last-minute before the sink, or the ever loved ""My Heart Will Go On"", master- pieces!!

James Cameron spent over a year with 300 people to digitally remaster the 1997 version into 3D. And the effort pays off, for it was fantastic to watch this masterpiece on big screen again. The 3D effect wasn't so great, but seriously, who cares?? It's TITANIC!! 3D or not, go re-live this magnum opus all over again!

2012-04-10,solyc,"frankly speaking, I wasn't a crazy fan of the film. but it's no doubt that Titanis in 3D attracts everyone's attention, and I'm one of them. no other film ever compares, the story, even though containing some cliché and flaws,touched my heart deeply, and with the fantastic 3D effect I felt myself sinking with other passengers.

love is eternal, so many affecting scenes drove me to tears:Jack hold Rose on the board and made her feel like flying, at the moment Rose smiled so sweetly and sincerely;Rose sat in the dinghy and couldn't divert her eyes from JACK,they gazed upon each other as if no one else around,and suddenly Rose jumped back to the ship and ran to JACK--she preferred to die rather than leave Jack behind;during the last minutes of sinking an old couple peacefully lied in bed and held each other in hand....there are untold impressive moments in this film, they show us how beautiful love is and how strong human's heart is.

critics may argue that the romantic story is far from reality.But we still believe in it!our hope for love will never die"

2012-04-09,shann135,"I saw Titanic on the big screen 15 years ago and fell in love with it. Since then, I have seen it a few times on TV, as well as watched it in VHS or DVD, and have continued to enjoy it very much. The 3D effects were okay, didn't matter to me, it was great to watch this beautiful film again on the big screen. It still moves me to tears, everything about the movie, including the breathtaking scenes, the touching love story, the gorgeous musical score, the amazing effects that are still impressive 15 years later. One of my favourite movies of all time, no doubt! Don't go to this movie looking for flaws, go see this movie with an open heart and let it sweep you away!!! James Cameron is a movie making genius!!!"

2012-04-07,ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven't been weakened with 3D technology.

Unfortunately, I can't overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to ""know"" each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.

What I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn't the case when Titanic first premiered.

The real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.

Here are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron's Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer's first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss' who owned the Macy's department store chain. And yes, there were Astor's and Guggenheim's onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose's mother, Karthy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fiancé, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to ""old"" Rose.

This is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story."
2012-04-07,dockbennett,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time.

The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening.

But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.

But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood."
2012-04-07,dfbrand-338-88890,"In 1996 I saw Titanic for the first time. I immediately knew this movie would make history. I heard and read all the criticism, especially by men. But let's be honest. This movie is the best love/drama/action movie of our era. It shows a lovestory in the middle of a historic disaster. I think we all search for such a love but seldom find it. Di Caprio does a great job, so does everybody else. But the heart of the movie is Kate Winslet. She should have won an Oscar for this role. Now in 2012 I saw Titanic 3D. Amazing! This film wasn't recorded in 3D but you can't tell. And the film still has that magic. If I ever get to be 90, I will still be watching it once every year. And it will still have it's magic. Well done James Cameron!"

2012-04-06,onumbersix,"Titanic in 3D. I had never seen this film before. Is that possible? At least not in its entirety, with bits and pieces here and there caught on TV throughout the years. At the time of its release, I said to myself: Ah, just another love story and besides I know the ending. I must admit now, it's not so bad. Quite good in fact. Almost 3 and a half hours well spent. While watching, I had a thought for my Grand-father who, had he crossed over only 2 years later, might have very well gone down with the Titanic and I wouldn't be here to tell the story. Finally, I don't particularly enjoy Céline Dion's choice of songs but I have to admit to a guilty tear when I hear the Titanic song."

2012-04-05,teja_smartvety,I watch this movie with this with great enthusiasm in 3D but it Don't reach that vigor and value of effects as in Avatar 3D as I consider that James would Repeat such Great effects in This movie but it looks like same old movie Well we are watching lot of 3D movies completely shot in 3D we always expect the thrill delivered by effects none of it meant as it on screen i Mean May be James want to show this movie again under the name of 3D but my valued suggestion if anyone have not watched this movie go watch it now but for 3D don't go it will leave you faded faces and boring talks lets well I may hope that in future may be if JC is willing to re-release any such kind of movies he better may think of effects side
2012-04-05,toma_kassem,"15 years ago, when Titanic was released, I was just about a 8-9 years old kid with no taste of movies, mainly into comedy ones, and the parental control of course, so it was obviously I didn't catch it in cinema . years later, I grew older, and as it was the teenage days, so watching it was mainly for the famous painting scene! it was the first and only one time I ever watched Titanic, regardless the countless repeating times on the TV, besides the wide availability on the internet. now with the re-release of Titanic in 3-D, I decided to give it a shot, although I usually hate the post-production 3-D conversion, and let me choose my words carefully, I admit this was the most immersive movie experience I had in a VERY long time!. forget about the 3-D which I'm not a big fan of it, but watching Titanic in cinema is beyond imagination! I walked out totally enchanted, and couldn't help myself from whistling James Horner's music over and over again! this is definitely a MUST-SEE in cinema!"
2012-04-04,aharmas,"15 years after this classic first hit, it's back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of ""Titanic"" without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new ""3D"" transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.

As everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it's still a question why De Caprio wasn't recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.

In the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.

It deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron."

And I am still nostalgia with this love movie.Every time when the prelude of MY HEART WILL GO ON played, all of the beautiful scenes will automatically and slowly play through my mind. It is like a story belonging to a very distant past and no longer exist any more.

Young Leonardo and Kate are really perfect couple. Jack and rose, they are full of passion,strong and honest.Dare you chase for your love by losing your life? dare you say to your lover that ""you jump I jump""?Think it over, dare you? Maybe we are looking for love, or we have been engaged or married to someone,but most of us lost romantic sense.We seldom taste the favor that love brings to us.Well,this movie really recall my memories about young love.So beautiful.

2012-03-25,acbaker-327-134602,"Even after fifteen years Titanic is still talked about so much. James Cameron has made this movie so big that even kids in elementary school know who Leonardo DiCaprio is. This film is more than just a love story, and many people will agree. The special effects that appear in this movie are spectacular. Well honestly if you're going to spend over $200 million dollars on making a film, it should be at least spectacular. The real reason this movie was excellent was because of Jim Cameron's undying devotion to the project's perfection. He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind. The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to an imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on something historical, and a film to idolize for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time. See for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (Don't be surprised if you cry too) 10/10 hands down."

2012-02-16,Steffi_P,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.

Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.

Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.

The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.

This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be."
2012-01-30,batterypark123,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensely, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.

As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not their best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!"
2012-01-28,UrsulaC-274-843971,"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around.

2012-01-02,gradyharp,"TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.

But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.

In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.

2011-12-23,bradleybarker71,Titanic is a movie that will never happen again a love story that is timeless with some scenes that you will never forget. The doomed ship called Titanic the unsinkable ship is the back drop for a love story that is unforgettable. James Cameron directs an amazing film which made stars out of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet it is one you will not forget. There is very little action but the social divide that comes between the main characters and one that they must overcome in order to be together. Titanic is a movie that you will watch again and again and it will amaze you more and more each time the lovers come together and you know it can never last as everybody knows the fate of the Titanic. A must see for romance adventure and history it deserves its place in movie history.
2011-12-12,esor3,"I know that this movie is pretty much half loved and half hated by the world. The first time I watched it I was 5 years old, I didn't really understand any of it at that age except the fact that there was a boy, a girl and a sinking ship. I then again watched it when I was about 10 or 11, I really started to have an interest in the history of Titanic and of course Leo DiCaprio. Every time it was on TV I would watch the whole thing.I fell in love with it, by the time I was the age I am now (15)I had known the movie by heart and understood every aspect of it. This movie is very close to my heart in so many ways. Some people might say, of course you love this movie your 15 and all you have on your mind is hot boys and love. I love it for many other reasons though, too many to list.

I have heard many opinions on Titanic, most were negative. The people who disliked it though hadn't seemed to understand it quite well. Maybe you have to see it a couple of times to really understand it. So if you have never seen this movie, go see it in 3D in April 2012. It's definitely worth watching, you might hate it, but I really recommend it. Everyone says the whole 3D thing is ""over rated"", but I think it will make the already great special effects even better. I have also never seen it on the big screen so I am extra excited. Over all I love this movie, it's unfortunate that it gets so much hatred."

2011-11-04,afselb,i don't care what this so called critics think about this film.personally i fell that this is the greatest movie ever made in the entire film industry of this planet.A touching and a memorable love story that every one keeps in their minds and a true incident of a disaster told in very heart full way.i think everyone watched dis movie will justify that.Am just disappointed to see such a low rating given to this film.There are many films IMDb with ratings above 9 that doesn't come any where near to this film.I don't want to name those films but this a true injustice done to this film after giving a true film for us to keep in our minds for the rest our lifes

2011-10-23,ElMaruecan82,"""Titanic"" was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by ""Avatar"", from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, ""Titanic"" has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'.

There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of ""Titanic"" became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge ""Titanic"" again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 

When ""Titanic"" was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the ""Titanic"" wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"". I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about ""Titanic"" at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'

But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how ""Titanic"" gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.

I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of ""Titanic"", we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.

A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way ""Titanic"" did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. ""Titanic"" has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters  as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.

""Titanic"" had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the ""Titanic"" has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like ""Independence Day"" one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the year after.

So, I loved ""Titanic"", I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" so deeper than ""Titanic"", love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy ""king of the world"" line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, ""Titanic"" is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.

So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say  uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking ""Titanic"" just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake"
2011-10-09,princesskitkat1,"When I first heard of the title and the year it was filmed in, I was a bit cynical of it and very reluctant to watch 3 hours of it. Although, after watching the whole movie from start to finish, I was on the edge of my seat with a tear in my eye. Since then I have watched it countless amounts of times and it never gets old and I can proudly call it my favorite movie.

Not just the 'love that can't be' storyline or the beauty of the ship, but the acting and effects are amazing!

Having random conversations will occasionally bring up the question 'what's your favorite movie?' and every time I say 'Titanic' and most of the time people will just look at me skeptically and say 'why?' as though it's such a crime to love a classic. I really do not see how people can hate this award-winning masterpiece.

This movie has sunken as far into my heart as the ship did into the ocean."

2011-09-22,mukundsworld,"Over the years many have tried hard to criticize this film. But if you will give your naughty mind a little rest then you can easily accept that its a masterpiece. James cameroon have done tremendous labor to make this film look so good. And actors of course have done a mind blowing job throughout the movie. Lets start with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well everyone knows that he has got some serious acting skills because it wasn't the first film where he has given a outstanding performance. And the same thing goes with the Kate winslet. She looked one hell of a beauty. I know many of you out there would have thought how can anyone look so .....its tough to describe how well she looked in this movie.

Anyways for those who have not seen this movie yet or who did not liked this movie..""THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU GUYS"""
2011-09-10,blood_summit,"***Spoiler Warning***

Since watching Avatar again recently, it's worth taking a retrospective look at some of James Cameron's other works. Most notably his previous record breaking film ""Titanic"".

Now being a wee bit cynical and not fond of romance, my instinct would normally be to dismiss this movie as awful and condemn it to the lowest pits of hell.

Despite this, I won't. I can see that there is some truly brilliant filmmaking that has gone on.

The first and most notable example is the setting.

The Titanic is recreated with incredible detail and attention to accuracy. From the sets to the costume department, the design team really outdid themselves, working from historical records and photos produced from hours and hours of extensive research. Speaking as someone with an interest in history, I can safely say that their homework really shows.

The score does a good job of adding a sense of drama to the movie itself and against all the odds, James Horner's Celtic take of the hammy and overdone and Celine Dion track ""my heart will go on"" manages to work well. The soundtrack does add to give a great sense of place and together with the visual setting adds some strong atmosphere.

The characters vary, some being well portrayed, others two dimensional. Billy Zane's character in particular seemed the threatening villain but managed to bring a vague sense of sly charm to him.

The heroine of Rose had the best character arc as her aristocratic identity is gradually pulled away, coming to a head to reveal astounding bravery when she goes deep into the ship to rescue an incarcerated Jack as it begins to sink.

The Jack character however seemed more of an everyman but his ""romantic and artistic wandering drifter"" character seems to be something of a character that had been seen before. Despite that (and his blatantly 90s boy band haircut), he is well portrayed.

The historical social divisions are well represented as the glamour and uptight attitudes of the upper classes contrast greatly with the boisterous and energetic lower class and not just with the passengers, the contrast between the buttoned up officers and the coal shovelling stokers and engineers are only glimpsed but offer a similar picture. In short, a broad picture of the ship and everyone residing on board is well represented despite the focus of the romantically charged main storyline.

The scale of the tragedy is also extremely well done as it builds up to the inevitable climax, turning from an initial creeping inevitability to a raging force of destruction with people helpless to do anything to prevent it.

It's also incredibly well shot. Many stand out in memory. In particular the one where Rose is standing alone in a corridor shouting for anyone to hear her. Others include the water beginning to creep slowly along the floor, the smashing plates as the ship tips and a transition from her sketch being drawn back to the present day Rose recalling the event. All of which is evidence of excellent cinematography and filmmaking.

Despite the atmospheric and broad picture painted, this is by no means a perfect film. The melodrama of the romance and some of the more famous moments come off as cheesy and you're less likely to be moved by their romantic aspirations (Its most famous scenes having been parodied into oblivion probably adds to this). This and the fact that it made a ton of money are two main reasons why ""Titanic"" is disliked as much as it is.

There is also some corniness in the Irish element of the third class. While their dancing and partying shown part way through the film does add a sense of fun and relief from the stuffy upper class, it comes across as a bit too cheesy at times as romanticised Irish in Hollywood had been done repeatedly many times before 1997 so by then it was an overused cliché.

Overall, this is a very well made movie and if you look beyond the clichés or the schmaltz then you will see that this is a movie does have a greater depth of artistic worthiness than you'd expect."

2011-08-16,jokimaa87,"It is easy to understand why falling in love as a teenager feels so dramatic, extraordinary and ""out-of-control"", because usually our brains don 't develop as fast as our hormone levels rises in our bodies. In the case of Jack and Rose, short romance on a sinking ship means a lot for them on a personal level. Rose is a prisoner of his mom who wants to sell her daughter to a rich man in order to support herself. From that viewpoint she seeks a person who could set her free emotionally from her mother. So she ends up to fall in love with a poor young man, who has nothing else to offer her but that masculine freedom of his. No money, just a feeling of independence. So on an emotional level, this is much about a young woman and her struggle against the overly controlling mother and the gender role of her time through passionate romance with Jack. To be a bit cynical, Jack 's death is not important when it comes to the message of this story but the idea of freedom he gave to her. Love doesn't die when the loved ones die because the very idea of love is to form a human. The more it forms you the greater the love has been. So it doesn't matter if it 's just a petty teenage romance if it means life to you as it did in the case of Rose. Jack saved her life in a way and that was the message of the story.Even if the essence of this film was the love story, it is as much a portrayal of social classes, gender roles, way of life and the strong faith in development during the time of Titanic. This is entertaining film for masses and in that category pretty well done."
2011-07-11,hussein-hakem,"I was still in 1st secondary school, I remember going to the cinema with the family & watching the highly anticipated Titanic, the whole cinema were in tears (I wasn't) & we all enjoyed it back then it was the biggest movies with biggest budget ever 200M dollars which was huge budget at the time they even built a full scale Titanic replica for the outside scenes & partial drowning scenes. It was a great movie & I ended up watching the drowning scenes over & over again And now, after 14 years & after graduation & employment, it is enjoyable & still keeping it's magic from acting & dramatic tragedy to the special effects & direction which also happens to be James Cameron the director of the box-office hit ""Avatar"" the highest grossing movie of all time Finally, I strongly recommend this movie for all future generations as our generation did by watching the Godfather & Casablanca"

2011-07-03,blazesnakes9,"One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ★★★★ 4 stars."

2011-05-29,tstrycula1,"This movie touches the hearts of many many Americans to this day. Not only will it stand the test of time, but it will remain in the hearts of many people throughout the world.This movie is so touching and moving that it makes you want to start balling right in front of everyone. Not only that, but it takes you on a thrill ride which will be unforgettable.

The acting in this film is absolutely superb and could not have been any better. The casting was selected so perfectly and carefully that it could not have gone wrong. And of course the director, James Cameron, is without a doubt one of the most amazing directors I've ever seen. He manages to make you cry, but at the same time is able to keep your heart racing. Not many directors can pull this off.

Another factor in this film which makes it so outstanding is the music. The music is very diverse in different parts of the movie. James Horner did an amazing job with the overall score. It can be either very suspenseful, or very soft and enlightening. And I don't know about you but when Celine Dion starts singing, there is no way that you can keep tears from staying in your eyes.

Okay sure this film can make you cry, we know this. But this is one of the only love stories to date to absolutely horrify people. Some of the scenes where the ship is sinking are horrendous. The visual effects are exceptional for a 1990's film. They really do look real and create effects which are shocking to watch.

Many people disagree that this is a remarkable movie just because it is not completely factual. Well guess what? Get over it. It was not made to be 100% accurate alright. It was meant to show the deep passion between two lovers and there willingness to save each others lives. For all you haters out there, we all know that you force your horrible opinions about a movie just so that you feel special. I mean who are you trying to kid? I know, you know, and America knows that this is one of the most mesmerizing and astonishing films ever made. This is an honorable movie and deserved each and every award that it got.

I cannot tell you how much a cherish this film and all of its glory. It is an absolute necessity for any movie collection and is a landmark and role model for any good film to come. Not very many films will ever top it. If this film does not get your heart racing then you don't have one at all. And if this film does not move you as much as it moved me, then you don't know what a good movie is. It will go down in history as one of those epic movies. One that will never be forgotten. And all the haters, don't worry you'll come to your senses one day. Overall, a complete 10 out of 10. An incomparable masterpiece of epic proportions."
2011-05-26,sumeena-rakwal,"I have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now. And every-time i see i feel like there is something new to it. It is the most amazing, wonderful movie i have ever seen. James Cameroon could not have got better actors than Leonardo and Kate Winslet to this movie. I have fallen in love with Jack since the first time i saw this movie. Never really occurred i could write a review about it, but today when i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought of opening my heart. The music, gosh i have never loved background score of any movie as much i love Titanic's. The band that plays when ship is sinking, the song my heart will go on- well nothing needs to be said about that. I have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance ever since i saw this movie. It is one grand movie ever made, you cannot not like even a single part of this one. I really want Titanic to have a sequel in which Jack would come alive somehow with some logic or something. This movie took my heart away, its astoundingly beautiful and mesmerizing. Jack Dawson is my love and Titanic will remain my favorite movie ever."
2011-05-21,nickmesafilms,"Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""

Oh, and speaking of the 3D re-release, it's worth your money! Even if this movie was made in 1997, James Cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3-D, and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3-D. Even if you wish that James Cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter, you still believe that every single detail that James Cameron added, had to be there in the movie. The 3-D literally draws you into the adventure, frankly because this is the type of 3-D that is used perfectly, just like in ""Avatar"". So, go out and watch it again in the special 3-D treatment!"
2011-05-08,sharmagaurav_78,"What a great movie.

James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""

Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.

A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive."
2011-04-26,amyperduexxx,"I absolutely adore this movie and i have done for years. It was only when I looked it up on the internet that I realized many people don't like it, which was news to me as everyone Iv spoken to about it loved it. It seems people on internet forums etc. think that by slating Titanic they will look ''cool'' and look like their ''in the know'' about films. Ha, please don't make me laugh. Slating Titanic and calling it 'the worst film ever' (which Iv seen many people call it) just makes you look absolutely clueless. This is a brilliant film and I would highly recommend it. Watch it for yourself and don't let ''movie buffs'' comments sway your own opinion."
2011-03-27,hassan-ilahi,"I am breathless and out of words for THIS film. No, its not the best film I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being. James Cameron is a true genius and he's the person to thank.

Titanic is a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives. This film is pure art and will never be forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy performances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He is simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even better, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is also, simply her best performance in her career.

Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights. This is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more wonderful than that.

Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this film has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and emotional; there isn't anything like it.

Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect in this timeless classic. It is also an unforgettable cinematic experience; as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects. James Cameron has got the big job done and has succeeded thoroughly.

'Go see it now, because you certainly won't be disappointed one bit with this film'"
2011-03-18,Red-Barracuda,"Seeing as Titanic is one of the most financially successful films of all time and whose storyline is know by almost everybody, I have decided not to base this review so much on the content of the film. Instead I would prefer to to look at how this movie is in fact something of a one-off historically.

The uniqueness of Titanic in film history is down to a couple of inter-related things. Firstly, it stands apart as being a picture that combines state-of-the-art special effects technology within the frame-work of a romantic epic. Never before or since has this been done and it goes some way to explain the film's phenomenal success. This leads onto the other element of Titanic that is unusual – the fact that a mega-budget blockbuster was quite clearly aimed primarily at women. Again, in the age of the blockbuster this tactic is just not the done thing. James Cameron has always been an action film director who is very female-aware. From Aliens through to Avatar, his movies always feature unusually strong women in central roles; often as the main identifiable action figure. So perhaps it's not, therefore, surprising that with Titanic Cameron should create the ultimate female-centric special-effects blockbuster. This approach paid off of course, women especially went in droves to see it, and the film went super-nova at the box-office.

For the first half of the film we have a romance. A cross-class romance that is doomed from the start, in the same way as we all know the famous ocean liner is. The parallels between these two story lines ultimately compliment each other – the love story gives the disaster a personal edge, while in turn, the disaster gives the love story an epic tragic quality. The first time I watched the film I thought the romantic plot was an unnecessary and annoying addition, the second time I began to understand that it gives the film an emotional basis that it feeds off. I now have a great deal more respect for this most unfashionable and often vilified of Hollywood movies. It's uniqueness in film history too in terms of its approach and audience demographic is also something worth at least a little respect. It's unusual combination of special-effects driven action with period-set romance is not likely to be repeated very soon, and Titanic, therefore, will at the very least remain a one-off in film history."
2011-02-21,lestatlove19,"If only the voting ratings were higher than 10 . . . I would give this grand film a 20. I watched it for the first time about four years ago or so, and let me just say, I bawl like a baby every time I watch it. It remains my absolute favorite movie. I LOVE the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack & Kate Winslet's Rose (you just don't see romances like that anymore, which is a shame). I enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end. James Cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an ""emotional doorway"", to use his words, to realize just how tragic the Titanic disaster really was by having them, as well as Jack & Rose, go through the events that led to the sinking . . . Did Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) ever do stuff like the things Jack did for Rose, risking his life because he loved her so much? I don't think so, because he didn't really care about her, or even love her for that matter . . . so Billy Zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate! All the other actors in this film, particularly Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart, & Bill Paxton, did fabulous as well. The scenery, the music (makes me cry even if I hum a few bars), the costumes, etc are FABULOUS! James Cameron, you are a genius & will be forever remembered for this epic masterpiece, for bringing this tragedy that happened a century ago, to astounding life!!!!! I applaud you for this tenfold. Bravo! Well done!"

2011-02-06,jdukes02,"For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated with the story of the Titanic. When I was a child I watched everything I could from TV documentaries to repeats of ""A Night to Remember"". I remember the excitement I felt when they finally found the sunken ship that had been missing for over 70 years. So, when I saw the first previews of James Cameron's movie about the Titanic in 1997, I was very interested in seeing it. That was until I heard that it was going to be a love story. Once I heard that, I was split on whether or not I wanted to see it. However, after reading more about the movie and the detail that was put into recreating the events of that fateful night, my interest was renewed. Cameron did an excellent job of blending a fictional story, albeit a love story, with the actual stories of the Titanic. His accurate use of facts such as a woman over hearing Ismay suggesting to the captain to light the last boilers. In that seen you can see a woman seated behind the two as she hears him tell the captain this. Another, is the story of the chef who survived the sinking. It is a well known fact that he was intoxicated at the time of the sinking, and that witnesses say that he stayed on the ship until the very end. But more importantly, I believe that through the use of a love story that connects with the viewer, Cameron was able to tell the story of all the lives that where lost that night and the pain that they must have felt. I know the movie made an impact on me, and not because of the love story, but because for the first time I saw the true story of the loss of life that happened that night."
2011-02-03,hydie-dunkle,"The film is an American romance/disaster film created to bring attention to the untold stories of the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.Camera angles used in the making put the viewer aboard the ship right along side of the other passengers. The lighting and sound effects are used in a way that put the final touches on one of the greatest films ever made. Characters were chosen perfectly, Kate Winslett playing Rose DeWitt Bukater and Leonardo DiCaprio playing the drifter, Jack Dawson. The two play out a love story throughout the film in the midst of the tragedy of the sinking ship. The director, James Cameron, had his work cut out for him in making this film, but he did a tremendous job."
2011-02-02,g-bodyl,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. I have never seen him make a bad movie. This and his most recent Avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films. I know when a movie is very good is when I choke up. I did that for several scenes in this three-hour epic. The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.

This is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.

The acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.

I can't see why people blast this movie with their criticisms. Maybe it was successful and it made tons of money.

Overall, this is one of the best movie of all times. There's a reason why it won eleven Academy awards. I rate this film 10/10."
2011-01-11,m_a_x_b_e_l_l,"Since Titanic's release in 1997, people have begun to criticize the film rather than congratulate Cameron on the difficulty of his creation. I am an 18-year-old male who usually despises romantic love stories. Regardless of this in my eyes the chemistry between Rose and Jack, respectable acting and a surprisingly convincing and moving storyline is unprecedented in film history. I critique movies all the time although sometimes the public and critics must look past technological superiority and complex story lines to enjoy the simplicity, emotionally affecting and timeless storyline of a film like Titanic. So please don't notice the glitches and problems with Cameron's filmmaking that people so often point out because it was over 10 years ago, a fantastic watch and the highest grossing film for a reason!!!"
2011-01-10,eval_2006,"Let me start by saying that I watched Cameron's Titanic several times and each time with the same interest and feelings. I am a male, but this movie brings tears to my eyes every single time. Obviously not everybody is affected by it it as much as I was, perhaps expecting to see a documentary rather then romance and a sad story (wonderfully acted and filmed by the way). One should realize that this is far from a clinical examination of how the most famous ocean liner actually sank, but is really a story about love and devotion which just happens (whether real or not) to take place on a sinking ship. I do not believe Cameron intended to give an accurate account of an historical event here, and I am surprised how some critics fail to realize this.

So if you're looking for a historical documentary, you won't find it here, but if you like a very well made romantic movie, some wonderful acting from Winslet and DiCaprio, and a drama created by a sinking ship you've come to the right place."
2011-01-07,jake-law123,"This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won't be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you've never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.

The story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.

Begins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.

The first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.

One of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn't screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!

This film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings."

2010-12-28,cinemaniac_x,"What movie comes to mind when you think of compelling, memorable characters, spectacular visual effects, a fantastic score, and a beautiful, tragic plot? What movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world? What movie has retained its charm and ­appeal for over a decade, and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history? The answer is Titanic, the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success. As the highest-grossing film of all time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Titanic raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappoint.

First, consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible: recreating the RMS Titanic and its fateful sinking. This task undoubtedly required much time, skill, and effort, not to mention a huge budget – at the time, Titanic was the most expensive film ever made. The ship's splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manage.

Another element of the film's success is the superb, talented cast. Most notably, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give commanding performances as Jack and Rose, the young star-crossed lovers separated by ­social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel. They are cast perfectly; a better choice could not have been made. Along with the rest of the cast, including Billy Zane as Rose's wicked fiancé and Gloria Stuart as Rose at age 101, they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences. By the conclusion, viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them, which is why the movie is so poignant and tragic.

So many years after its theatrical release, Titanic still has not lost what made it such a success. This moving, simply beautiful story about fate, disaster, and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece."

Well, here you go. Once the no. 1 box office champion of all time (beaten just recently by AVATAR, which was also directed by TITANIC director James Cameron) and a forerunner as the most popular movie of all time, there's really no way to sink this TITANIC from the popularity and relevance it has on modern pop culture. Did it deserve all the praise or was it an overrated piece of fluff? Doesn't matter what anyone says about it now. Like it or hate it, there's no putting it down now.

But even with the multitude of backlash it got, TITANIC is still a great movie. Sure, it has its flaws (just as Cameron's new AVATAR has flaws). But counting them down would be irrelevant to the overall beauty of the film. Its sweeping wonder, spectacular scale, and unforgettable storytelling that pulled audiences in and it still does. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the stars of the picture that eventually became household names during the film's release, got more serious with their careers and got more significant roles, and they owe just as much to TITANIC. Their performances as the star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose are believable enough to make us believe that they had something special. Many who diss on Cameron not being able to write a love story may have their points (there are some cheesy dialogue here and there), but you got to hand it to him; he knows how to establish chemistry between the two.

TITANIC could have been done using the standard disaster movie format (multiple characters, silly subplots), but the addition of the romance adds that old-fashioned Hollywood feel to it reminiscent of those classic romances from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The supporting cast, including Frances Fisher, a spunky Kathy Bates, the wonderful Gloria Stuart, and others, are terrific. But the final touches to TITANIC is the titular vessel itself. Using the latest in special effects technology, Cameron is able to bring back the Titanic from its watery grave. Every detail is expertly crafted and further enhancing the experience of being in the Titanic.

In spite of its very few flaws, TITANIC is an absolutely timeless epic."

2010-12-18,mg3-926-816857,"Titanic was a movie that was based on the tragedy, and a fictional love story. The beginning of the film is interesting yet it lacks a little bit. However as the film goes on and reaches the climax, the film starts to make you feel worried, and love the characters. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet did an awesome job playing the characters, and James Cameron really proved to be an awesome director. The effects were so real and so awesome that there is no word. This movie won the right deserved best picture title. This is James Cameron's best film, and the post converted 3d release in 2012 won't fail to capture the heart of Titanic fans."

2010-11-18,mksandhu52,"Titanic is just fantastic, everything about this film is just wonderful from the actors, costumes, sets, music everything... Even the love story between Jack and Rose may not be true, it just feels so real when watching the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is just wonderful, his character Jack is so sweet and lovely. I am sure every girl wants a guy like Jack who has it all. Kate Winslet is just out-of-the-world as character Rose. She gave an Oscar winning performances in Titanic. Billy Zane plays his character Cal very well. Kathy Bates plays her character Molly Brown (Who is a real character) very, very, very well. She was the right actress for the role. All of the other cast members were fantastic!

My favourite scenes are: Titanic re-lives, Rose Jumping Off the Titanic, Heart of the Ocean necklace, 3rd Class Dance, I'm flying, Rose drawing, the sinking of the Grand Staricase, the break-up of Titanic, the final moments of Titanic, the ending...

James Cameron did a very good job in making this movie. For me, it is his best film. Again, for me Avatar may be the biggest movie of all time, but Titanic will remain as the biggest movie in my heart and head! Well, Titanic is still the second biggest film of all time... Also the I'M FLYING SCENE is the biggest and best scene in the history of Hollywood up to today.

Overall a MUST SEE MOVIE! Get the DVD now! Even the deleted scenes were excellent...

My Titanic review: 10/10 EXCELLENT!"

2010-10-21,mlwitvliet,"Titanic is without a doubt a great movie. A lot of the haters are breaking down the movie for the wrong reason. It's not about bad acting or bad special effect. The movie is an absolute masterpiece in that, no question about it.

What is it about then??? The script! And i'm totally agreeing on that. The film is based on one of the biggest shipwrecks in history an James Cameron is paying an utterly disrespect to make a romantic movie over a shipwreck that actually happened and it leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth. But this is Hollywood! a fictional world and we always have to keep this in mind.

yes, Titanic WAS the ship of dreams and had story's enough to tell on it's own accord. That James Cameron didn't use this is a real shame. But again, this is Hollywood, the fictional world!!! In my opinion it should have been the filming of Futility, the book that was written 14 years before Titanic sank and showed a striking resemblance to the events that really happened on Titanic. Then you don't have to worry if the events that really happened are filmed accurate but alas, it isn't. It's a romantic story and a good one. It is a story that could have happened on Titanic and you feel for all the characters and a film should't be utter rubbish just because the script isn't a replica of the real events.

Therefore I don't mind it became a blockbuster but it suits that it isn't in the top 250 of best movies in the world which somebody else complained about. When a movie can't pay respect to real events it shouldn't receive respect. And it doesn't."

I could watch this movie and only this movie for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. I love it so much, there is no movie in the world that is better than it. It is so romantic and dramatic and the two blend together so perfectly that it makes the whole movie such a beautiful piece of life for me and this movie has brought so much light to my life.

2010-10-11,rgnewell,"It is easy to see why Titanic won so many Academy Awards. The special effects are incredible! I watched the movie on the TCM channel last week quite by accident. I had told myself that I would probably never see it because teen girls were seeing it a dozen times, and that made me a bit suspicious. I asked my wife if she had ever seen it. She said, like me, she had seen it on TV. My friends tell me that it is best seen in a big screen theater, but it is too late for that. Also, it is getting harder and harder to find big screen theaters. My wife, a reader, told me that it was not much of a movie. Her definition of a movie is one that fully develops the characters, and in the case of Titanic, the movie was just a vehicle for a love story between Leonardo and Kate. I was told that you could see the plot coming down the pike, and you could. I asked if it was not also the role of a movie just to entertain and was told that that is not enough. In thinking about what I was told I could appreciate that Titanic was not a great movie, but it was sure entertaining and jaw dropping, and I am not just talking about the sketching scene."

throughout my lifetime i never gave this movie a chance I always had the DVD lying there and eventually I moved I would see my mom watching it when I was 5 years old which is when it came out I have to admit the hype around this movie is acceptable finally last night though

i kept watching it till the end both actors Caprio and Winslet

have done a great job it's even pretty touching in some parts amazing

how much money went into making this movie it was worth it the

direction the epic scenes of watching Winslet and Caprio trying to survive throughout the whole ordeal was fun to watch I highly recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it."

2010-09-11,lucianomarzo92,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism.

A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.

Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.

Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.

A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.

I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie."

2010-09-05,blanche-2,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.

Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.

There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.

If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life."
2010-09-05,rockbandlover22,"This is an amazing movie, plain and simple. The acting is great, the visuals are incredible, it's all good, all of it. I have one nag about this movie. I have a hard time believing that Jack and Rose would be THAT much in love after only knowing each other for like, 3 days. Seriously? They've known each other for 3 days and their having sex. That really annoys me, but other than that, everything is brilliant. The first half of the movie is well acted by everybody, the cinematography is beautiful throughout, it's all great. The second half of the movie is utter brilliance beyond belief. I was almost crying watching that ship sink. James Cameron is a genius. Everything about this movie is awesome except the fact that Jack and Rose didn't know each other for more than 3 days. The writing was a little cliché and hokey, but all-in-all, this movie is beyond awesome, and is one of my favorites."
2010-09-03,starlit-sky,"We all know the story of Titanic. Telling it through the eyes of ordinary characters would be dull. James Cameron smartly decided to make this a movie about romance between two lovers Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). I think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them, and of course, to the ship. This is a very sad story - as you might guess. The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned. The only thing that bothers me every time Kate and Leonardo co-star in a movie, it is always Kate that gets nominated and Leonardo is always passed. I hope his day will come soon."
2010-08-25,blewesky,"I was only 5 years old when this movie came out so I never saw it until years later. I think I was 9 at the time and I liked it but it didn't completely register until I hit about 14, go figure! You still can't deny how perfectly gorgeous Leo looked in the movie. It's impossible to take your eyes off him. I know guys have to feel the same way even if they never admit it.

I think I've watched this movie, start to finish at the very least 50 times. It's one of those few movies that feels different every time you watch it and never gets old. It's like the Gone With The Wind of modern day from what my grandma tells me. All in all, it shows that love conquers all. But the ending, UGH. I about died the first time I saw it and was left feeling depressed for weeks."
2010-08-23,iKissAndTell,"Titanic enriches us with a romantic story of young love, passion and feelings, full of utopias and dreams, mother and child fighting for power and greed, idealistic and self-identified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity. This is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years. The huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that Titanic has one of those stories full of strength and feeling, with great dramatic content. If we add the stunning beauty of the image, thanks to advances in digital technology, success is understandable. Very successful movie, which tells the story of the sinking of the ship, but in the background shows a passionate love story. It achieves a harmonious balance in that, in the mix of history and feelings, and makes it almost perfect."

2010-08-02,nikolaijoker,"Titanic Review: Titanic was written so poorly by James Cameron, that it felt like a comedy. I don;t want to be rude or anything, but it was just so horribly written that I couldn't anything in it seriously. Including the sinking, and I might have bin laughing. Don't take me for a nasty person, it's James Cameron's fault. One part that really annoyed me was the fact that Cameron tried to makes us cry and be dramatic by sticking a dead baby in the water. It made me say, ""What are you trying to do James?"". I mean, he was purposely trying to be dramatic and when you do that, it fails. It failed for me. It was just a dumb thing to do and I really thought it was a horrible movie. If you think the screenplay in this movie was good, then you really need a doctor."
2010-07-19,Erichnathanbennett,"This is honestly the best romance movie I've ever seen. The effects of the movie were amazing. Yes I did cry to this movie and I have seen many depressing movies including Angela's Ashes (if you have not seen it then I recommend you do not see it b/c you will literally cry to death) and this has been the only movie I've cried to. And I don't care if you say its too depressing to watch. I watched it a second time and I cried just as much as I did as the first time. And you know what, it was great. If you have a girlfriend/wife, and if neither or one of you hasn't seen it, go see it together. She will cry (maybe) but you will get laid. How do I know this; experience.

2010-07-14,colebt33-780-179547,"It's really only half a good film. But then again it's hard to make a romantic film that good anyway. James's Carmon's Titanic has obtained a place for itself in the history of film. Maybe because of it's huge box office success, or possibly it's utter domination at the 1998 Academy Awards, winning 11 categories including Best Picture. The film has been recognized for it's amazing cinematography and equally stunning visual effects, as well as immaculate sound editing, and an empowering musical score. It's quite an achievement and I have to give James Cameron grabs for it. And unlike most chick flicks Cameron actually has something to talk about rather than just a touchy love story. Like for example the concurrence of rich and poor, because in a disaster situation the amount of money you have in your pocket is not going to save you. There are many classical moments in this film to be remembered. There's three specific scenes that I'm not going to spoil for you that have an incredibly romantic yet tolerable essence to it, but mainly because Cameron delivered it in the very best way possible. The bottom line is that Titanic is a film to be remembered, we remember Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCapprio's wonderful on screen chemistry, Celine Dion's uplifting voice, and James Cameron's exceptional take on the most famous shipwreck ever. You can try and forget this chick flick like you would with any other, but you will not succeed."
2010-07-12,longcooljolie,"So far, this is the most heavily user-reviewed movie I have encountered in IMDb. Here is yet another one (sorry)! During the summer of 1997, the studios ran grand coming attractions for ""Titanic,"" which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to Jack and Rose. It was tempting to think ""...why even see the movie? You already know what is going to happen!"" The movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998. The theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare (my sister swears that the cinema in Cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengers).

On the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.

Think about the whole ""king of the world"" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the ""flying"" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet's uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.

What is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane's turn as an elegant cad, David Warner's perfect casting as the classy ""thug"" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.

According to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment."

The romantic relationship between the two leads is an obvious take on films like the African Queen however it comes across as terribly cliché making the audience cringe instead of cry although a few friends of mine did cry because of how awful they thought the film was. when we finally get to the sinking of the titanic we expect a spectacle we will never forget. The effect is good but it still doesn't make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The acting is dry, lacking any charisma and the result is like watching William Shatner for a few hours. Titanic really does not deserve the 11 academy awards it ""won""(clearly it was nominated by a group of shallow and insecure teenage girls).So far the only film that deserved that amount was Ben-Hur."

2010-06-08,Seersha1,"An historical film, to be sure (it made history at the box office). A classic? Probably one day, I don't think enough time has passed to truly call this a classic just yet, but of course it definitely has all the makings of one. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio shot to fame with this film, and I have to say even though they are OK, I don't think either of them struck me with their talent. They are both marvelous actors, but it wasn't until years later that I really believed that. Still, they have wonderful chemistry and make the love story believable and heartfelt. As for the film itself, it is a grand scale film, really something to enjoy on a big screen if possible. Although over the years it seems people have come to view this film with much indifference, it is a film worth seeing if you haven't already, and if you have, it is one to revisit every few years."
2010-06-06,lbabe29,"Its been 13 years since James Cameron award winning epic hit the theatres and took the world by storm. Even after all these years Titanic is just as impressive, this is truly a film that will never lose its power, easily on par with the classic epic ""Gone With The Wind"" and in my personal opinion it may even be better.

The romance between the beautiful upper class Rose (winslet) and the poor,charming Jack (dicaprio) is truly one of the most beautiful and touching ever put to screen. Theirs is a romance so passionate, trusting and ultimately tragic is hard not to be moved. Rose and Jack also happen to be one of the greatest and most memorable couples in cinema history.

A massive part of making this couple so memorable its the wonderful performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Winslet is captivating as the spirited Rose, you really feel her inner torment at her restricted life, her overbearing mother and controlling husband-to-be Cal. Dicaprio lights up the screen with his charm, easily one of the best actors of his generation he gives another strong, highly natural performance as the free spirited jack. As a character Jack is also incredibly likable, the ideal man in all respects, its very easy to see why Rose could fall so head over heels for this handsome artist. Winslet and Dicaprio also have extraordinary chemistry making their performances even better as they play perfectly off one another.

Supporting cast also do a great job, Kathy Bates gives a great warmth and sense of humour to Molly Brown, Billy Zane is brilliant as Cal, providing just enough to make him the perfect villain but there is a sense of humanity there to. Frances Fisher playing Rose's cold and snobbish mother Ruth is perfect in everyway.

Simply put James Cameron knows how to direct, he has a knack for creating these thrilling, visual masterpieces that rival anything we have ever seen (Titanic,Avatar). Titanic is an epic through and through, the sets are incredible and the cgi is still highly impressive (in fact it is miles better than 99% of todays cgi). You actually feel you are on the Titanic yourself such is the care and attention to detail within this film. The last act which involves the sinking of the ship is possibly some of the most thrilling pieces of cinema ever captured. This is Hollywood at its best.

Camerons writing skills are less impressive, this is far from a perfect, mind blowing script but it is a good one nonetheless. There are some wonderful exchanges between Jack and Rose as they begin their love affair and thanks to a mixture of talented actors and sweet dialogue it all works wonderfully. My only, very minor issue with the dialogue would be the overuse of ""jack"" and ""rose""...for example i believe Rose utters the word ""jack"" 78 times, Cameron seems to forget that we don't actually use peoples names 24/7....however this is just a very minor fault and really does nothing to spoil the film what-so-ever. There are some cheesy lines (as would be expected in a romance) but they work thanks to the actors delivering them, they are uttered with such passion,heartbreak,joy that they end up sounding natural and in fact totally in place.

The score by James Horner is breaktaking, a soundtrack of epic proportions to say the least. Horner succeeds in creating a score that is larger than life and at the same time highly unconventional. He knows when to be soft and subtle which is hard to find in most soundtracks today. Arguably some of his best work this score only furthers this films breaktaking execution.

Despite minor script flaws and some small historical inaccuracies Titanic is still in my mind a perfect film. Such is the level of care put into this film, such is the level of talent from everyone to the stunt men, actors,set designers etc that any flaw is soon forgotten or even better not even noticed.

This film is a touching,beautiful romance, its an epic thriller, its a period piece and its an action film....this film has everything any audience member could ever want and it strikes a perfect balance between them.

One of the greatest films of the 20th Century Titanic is an epic like no other."
2010-06-02,lleeric,this movie is the best movie i seen in years. This movie is about 3 hours long and it felt like the movie was only 1 hour. Leonardo DiCaprio did an awesome job in this movie. So as Kate Winslet. James Cameron is the best director ever. This movie made me cry. The very last part is very sad. A very good movie about a titanic ship and about a women's life. All the people who think this is a f*** sh** think again... Cause' If you hate this movie you have no life. Anyways very sad and good movie. This movie is very underrated. It should be in the top 250 list. I recommend this movie highly. Please go see it now! My Rating:10/10

2010-05-17,Hollywood_Yoda,"In this, James Cameron's first masterpiece, we see the Titanic like never before, romanticized, with a love story to boot! When released in 1997, Titanic was expected to be a financial flop for Paramount and Fox studios, who had put up a record amount of production money, only to wind up with the highest grossing film of all time. A record that was kept for twelve years, until Cameron's next film, 'Avatar' outsold Titanic's ticket sales in 2009. We find Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and Billy Zane in a love triangle to trump all love triangles prior! The film, although partially based on actual events and made up people, was a hit with audiences in the summer of 1997, breaking box office records from start to finish. A great cast and great direction, along with the most up-to date special effects of the time make for a splendid experience, 8/10."

2010-05-08,meatloaf6,"This movie is the greatest of its genre. I might almost dare say it is my favourite film. The casting is just spot on, the love story puts you through every emotion imaginable and the way the ending is portrayed is pure brilliance.

I did not cry in this movie, I'm a 17 year old guy. However i did come out feeling like i was mourning a loved one. This is the single most powerful movie I have ever been lucky enough to see, with nearly the whole of the first half making me smile with happiness and the second making me feel nothing but despair.

This film is revolutionary, and an absolute must see."

2010-04-11,cyndymarks,"Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.

I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water.

Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book."

2010-03-30,mastermike14,"Apart from Titanic being one of the best movie ever produced it is also the second highest grossing movie of all time as well. A movie does not make $1.8 billion dollars world wide with out being incredible brilliant.

Titanic is more than just a movie about a ship that sinks its a classic romance love story about a rich girl and a poor boy. An unspoken love that could never truly be. The rich girl who is trapped in her high class elegant lifestyle forced to marry a wealthy man who she does not love. Then by happenstance she runs into Jack Dawson and their love develops from there.

The acting is magnificent. The movie was very well written and no expense was spared in bring Titanic back to life. Everything looks as elegant as it would have on the real Titanic. Parts of the story may be a bit cliché yet the movie is still very enjoyable."

2010-03-18,Ziya90,"Let's start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc."

2010-03-16,drjones1,"A true moving epic that quite literally moves you off your feet as you are swept into a class driven land of its own. Cameron will never better this film as it is the best he's ever made in my opinion. The acting is top notch, the script is even better and his use of colour, fades, and cuts make the movie a true work of art. The storyline cannot be questioned throughout as it is 100% true which is the true beauty of this utter work of art...I must have seen this film over 10 times and every time i watch it the music is outstanding and use to superb effect throughout the film. This tear dropping epic should be seen by all and admired by all of us. Cameron Avatar was amazing but this is better..."
2010-03-15,Rockin_Joe_87,"If there's any movie that will make you fall in love, this would be it. The setting is beautiful and the performances from the cast compliment the film nicely, particularly the leading roles portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and the deservedly Oscar-winning Kate Winslet. The romance shown is one that will have you in tears and will make you fall in love yourself. You do engage with all the characters nicely, particularly couples watching who are in love themselves, the story really draws you in, and also the ending is almost guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues as you dry your tears. There is no wonder that this is considered possibly the most romantic movie ever shown on screen and the ultimate tear-jerker!"
2010-03-13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10"
2010-03-12,hyper777,"This is an INCREDIBLE movie. Every bit of it was beautifully shot, and the accuracies to the look of the actual Titanic were miraculously on point. This movie is, in one word, iconic. Everyone knew the Titanic, and now everyone knows this movie. It is arguably one of the most famous love stories of all time, and although the concept is tired: rich girl meets poor boy, they can't be together, etc., the fact that they are aboard the infamous RMS Titanic is reason enough to consider it different. Every scene is gorgeously picturesque, and makes for some of the most memorable movie moments ever.

The actors are also great, and the characters really make this story. Although Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet aren't quite yet at their prime in their most famous movie, they play these characters convincingly and with a lot of heart. You feel for them every step of the way, and DiCaprio and Winslet have a chemistry that simply can't be matched. You can tell how much they care about each other as people, and that translates into a fiercely protective, emotionally powerful romance on screen.

Overall, this movie is one of the best out there. Its length (around three hours) may bother some people, but it never feels tedious to watch. James Cameron is an impeccable director that looks to make every detail perfect, and some of the small, seemingly insignificant scenes he added were a few of the most moving of the entire film. Titanic is a passionate, beautiful story of a doomed love that will keep your heart racing and your tears flowing until the very end."
2010-03-10,federicobautista,"The years past fast and I still remember when everyone talked about going to see the movie Titanic. I don't like to go to the movies so I didn't care much about it. However, as the weeks passed my interest on going to watch the movie increased. Finally, one day my family invited me to go see it, and I decided to go to the theater. The movie impressed me a lot, it was sincerely wonderful. I still remember the scene when Jack took Rose to the end of the ship, and she opened her arms, while a beautiful song played and the wind hit her hair. The fact that the romantic story developed from a historical event made the movie more interesting. The effects that portrayed the crash and sink of the Titanic ship were incredible. Finally, the end of the movie seemed as sad as it had to have been when thousands of people lost their lives when the ship sank in 1912. Good luck to James Cameron (Director), Leonardo DiCaprio (main actor), Kate Winslett (main actress) and all of those who made possible the production of this jewel of the cinematography world."

2010-03-01,catch_a_fire_2079,"I remember boycotting Titanic for years. We were taught about the Titanic in school, so when the movie came out, I thought it was pointless, we all knew the ship hit an iceberg and sank.

Well after it came out on VHS, I happened to see it one day and it did not disappoint. I don't like the genre of romance so much, but this movie made me appreciate a good love story.

Yes it was the classic Romeo and Juliet scenario, or rather rich girl poor boy. But it was so much more. The acting was superb, I didn't like Leo before this film, and Kate took the cake, especially when she was posing nude...

This movie put a face (although fictional) to the thousand or so people that died that night in icy water off of the coast of Newfoundland. You almost felt the thousand knives stabbing you as Leo and Kate were plunged into the water. You kinda felt like the King of the World when Leo was flying high.

The Movie was very well acted, the set was amazing, down to every last detail...even the plates said Titanic on them, you really felt you were in the opulent world of the early 20th century high society. The story telling was also beautiful. You also got a taste of what it might be like to party with the ""2nd class"" immigrants that were coming for a new life in America...I really felt the sense of adventure all the actors tried to portray.

I highly recommend this movie.

Not sure why it's not in the top 250 on IMDb, also anyone that would give this film 1 star doesn't know much about movies."
2010-02-28,jakxdizzy,"i love this move and after 13 years of movies that lost its sense in true love this movie was quite refreshing. i must say that this movie is the best movie ever created, produced, imagined. this movie brought me to tears. i find that the movie ""Avatar"" also one of Cameron's films of outstanding after the 4th time i have watched it but i must say that ""Titanic"" was by far much better. Kate Winslet (rose) was a perfect woman for the job, i only wish that i was in love with this person in such a manner but of course nothing like this happening (lol, might sound kind of creepy but i hope not in a negative way) anyways, this movie is by far my most favorite i think that it completely smashes every movie including ""Avatar"" into little bits. however, i found that this movie will always be my favorite. i feel like after watching this film that i kind of seek a love that is with a person like Kate Winslet in this film but as life is not perfect it will only be a dream. lol, i almost forgot that this was a review, lol, but overall, this is a great movie to watch over and over, and over.i also believe that this would be a great film to watch over and over again 1,000 years from now even 100 years from now, i believe that this film will still be the best film ever created, produced, and imagined. and like the love in this film i believe that the heart will go on. i highly recommend, that you see this film."
2010-02-24,bluesman-20,James Cameron's masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron's Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What's eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose's Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose's Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron's dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio's Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful. James Cameron created a masterpiece and maybe the movie by which he will always be remembered.

2010-01-24,zactac,"When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven't seen the movie yet you will) you'll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.

Just about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn't really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I'm one of those people. For those of you that haven't seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.

This is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn't love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.

This is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990's. A must-see for all movie goers."
2010-01-24,lawdymrclawdy,"I've never fully understood the backlash this film received a while after it was released, and never fully understood the 7.3 rating on IMDb. I genuinely believe this is one of the finest films of all time. I don't believe any film has ever connected with an audience in such an emotional way before.

From the very beginning when Brock Lovetts ship searches through the rubble of the titanic on the sea bed for the heart of the ocean, we are hooked. All the events that lead up to the tragic scene at the end, just build the emotional scale to devastating proportions. The set is incredible, and the special effects are awesome, its very rare that a film so epic can be so personal and poignant(lord of the rings being one of the few others).

But i believe a film has to be that long to connect with an audience in such a way, through the out whole film Cameron and the cast build you up to the heartbreaking scenes at the end, which could never have been achieved to the same effect in a 2 hour film.

I implore you to see this film, or give it another chance if your one of the people who jumped on the anti-titanic band waggon."
2010-01-18,www-jats,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensely, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.

As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not their best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!"
2010-01-13,shweta-lagisetty,"When I enquired my cousins about this movie they said that this is a OK movie. But to my astonishment when I watched the movie its awesome. Later I got to know that the tragic ending of the movie is not appealing to them.

May be this is one of the reasons why most of the people could not forget this movie. Though it has got a tragic ending, it stages a wonderful love story that blossomed between a poor guy named Jack and a rich lady named Rose. It is a beautifully and carefully carved love story. I could not stop crying in some scenes. With titanic as backdrop, James Cameron perfectly presented the drama. You may say ""Ohh..its a routine love story with a bit of change in backdrop"". No I wont agree with you. It leaves a lasting impression in your heart. Making to the top of the World-wide Box Office records is not a common thing and this adds strength to my statement.

The music in the movie is enthralling. Both Kate and Decaprio are in their tender age and are wonderful. I watched this movie many times skipping the last tragic scene when Jack dies. This scene almost squeezes my heart. As a whole the movie can be concluded as a master piece."
2010-01-08,chazska,"I've given the movie Titanic a few chances as a movie I should watch as a lot of people keep telling me that it's a good movie. But no matter how many times, I always manage to leave the couch and find something else to do, or fall asleep, or this one time I forced myself to keep watching, I had this inexplicable feeling of nausea as I watched. It has failed to keep my eyes glued to the screen as a movie lover.

Good acting IMHO, I like the attention on scenic details, nice effects, it's got a lot of aspects that's supposed to make a movie successful (and I suppose these aspects had served their purpose), but the story and characterization are just... corny, and I get the feeling it's already been done for years and years. To be honest, it's like a romantic (corny) sexual fantasy of a curious teenage virgin from some decade ago with a grandeur setting. Not that I have anything against that turned into a movie, but why bother? The theme wasn't ""Titanic"" to me. The theme was ""Jack n Rose's Tragic Love on whats-it-big-cruise-ship-that-sank""

Boring. I can ""fantasize"" something better. But at least somebody managed to make a movie out of it and made money, while I've never made any movie, so what do I know, huh? Well, at least all I know is that this movie just didn't impress me, and to top it off... What the heck is Celine Dion doing, singing that corny sappy hopeless romantic (emphasize on hopeless) theme song?

They really tried hard to be ""titanic"" I suppose, that in my eyes, they end up the same as Titanic. *crack... *bye bye"
2010-01-07,d_crashman,"An epic movie, which you will remember for the rest of your life after you'll watch it. Simply the kind of movie, which you can't describe in words, you have to watch it, at least once! , to see what we, the people who appreciate this movie, are talking about. After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed. And the casting was great, i don't want to hear any stupid replies that DiCaprio is a bad actor, hell no ! Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever. Those who are calling this a bad movie, i hope you people never watch a movie ever again, cause i assume all you know is teenage comedies and horror movies. Also, please stop calling us ""pathetic titanic fan boys"", this is not twilight where 15 year old girls claim it to be the best movie because Robert Pattinson is part of the cast. I am a man, i watched this movie 3 times already, and i didn't cry, i just know how to appreciate a well made movie, WE, all of us that do, millions of people, much more then those of you that hate it, claim this to be a superb masterpiece. And the few of you that didn't enjoy it, i am glad, i am glad that you aren't capable of appreciating good movies, and i hope you stick with the genres i stated above, you didn't even deserve to watch it actually. I recommend this film to everybody, no matter the age, and if you didn't like it (unlikely), keep your opinions for you, they are not welcomed here, as you definitely don't have any idea how a good film looks like."
2010-01-06,moviesleuth2,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.

I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!

""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.

The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.

Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.

""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.

James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).

I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it."
2010-01-04,mohinder78,"this movie will not earn as much money as it did if it were not AT LEAST excellent.

it's good for movies to have integrity to the facts if it boasts that it is based on a true story. yes but ... all i know is that i rather spend my time and money watching this than the titanic feature of discovery channel. i may have been less informed of the titanic facts, but who cares? it's a ship that sank in some era when my grandfather was not even born yet.

i would have forgotten all about a ship called titanic by now if the film wasn't this great -- do you care about any other ship than sank some bajillion years ago other than titanic? i don't think so."

2009-12-20,AlexisLaree,"I've seen a lot of films, yet this is one of the few that has beauty which isn't just mastered in the cinematography. It's a film which will not only strike you in the tear-ducts, but in heart as well. It gets a lot of criticism for reasons I can't seem to find cogent, maybe it's because certain users favourite movies haven't made as much as this at the box office? I don't know. But either way, does an over-hyped film that didn't live up to it's expectations make it horrible? Absolutely not. And just because you don't like the artist, it doesn't mean you can't appreciate the work. The film isn't supposed to be based upon facts, the Titanic was the foundation used to build one of the greatest love stories in film history. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and most of all, it will leave a lasting finish on you, whether it's a good finish, or a bad one; the music, the emotion, everything about this film will make you want to grab the person next to you and tell them you love them. A powerful movie that strikes you deep within the ocean of our hearts."
2009-12-20,d-apergis,"Alleged period love story in which the big budget and special effects ultimately win over the human characters. The recreation of the era and the enactment of Titanic's doomed fate are all carefully and meticulously crafted, which is the least that can be said about the corny romance between the two principals, which feels and looks like a cheap paperback written by an amateur. Cameron is primarily a Hollywood technocrat and his films have never had any great demands on intellectuality, as is the case here which on its own merits is still decent pop entertainment. That said, this has to be the most overrated movie of all time."

2009-12-16,KnowOne1988,"Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. ""I'll never let go, Jack."" Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie."
2009-11-12,AlsExGal,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.

However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.

Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.

I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.

This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.

Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film."
2009-11-09,usman4673-578-963125,"This movie conveys that the inequality and unfair treatment between the elite and proletariat must be corrected. The differences between the classes provide value to decisions in the span of human life. The passengers of the Titanic had their destinies decided through classes. The sinking of Titanic, which combined the destiny of survivors with the deceased, proves resolutely that 'class' is indeed, 'life chance'. Conclusively, the movie Titanic exposed the fact that social stratification, not seaworthiness, decided the fate of many of Titanic's victims on its maiden voyage from England to New York on April 15th, 1912.

In conclusion, the scenes of the Titanic prove that ""history is based on unending class conflict."" The 700 first-class passengers, as the 'chosen people' on lifeboats, see the final moments of the Titanic and the other 1500 people, which descend into the North Atlantic Ocean, as despairing third-class passengers. The sinking resulted primarily in the death of women, consisting of 45% in the third-class, 16% in the second-class, with only 3% in the first-class."

2009-10-12,jonathanruano,"Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.

Yet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner's music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down."
2009-10-08,The_Stuff_of_Dreams,"Say what you will about the gooey love story, but do not contest the film being a masterpiece. Never has a film inspired such emotion in me, such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen. The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears."

Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.also she is very beautiful actress.the start and end of this film was very good. I find it so amazing that even after all these years,two months ago i rewatched this film ,i thought differently from before.i think love is the strongest power in the world and people can.do anything for their lover .Personally, I LOVE this film.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten."

When jack and rose were in the sea,jack found a piece of wood and helped rose crawled onto the wood and in the end jack froze to death.It really touched my heart.

At that time i really liked Leonardo DiCaprio,because i think he is very handsome,and he is a good actor.

the sets and the cinematography were amazing. i can understand why this film won so many awards i think Kate and Leo were amazing on screen together and that this is why they have starred in more movies together."
2009-10-05,Herbest8,"This is, without question, one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years. This is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars? Two pretty people (Leo and Kate) who will never be compared to Clark and Vivian but nobody's perfect.

This is a real hit and miss film. The cons are just huge: the framing story is completely unnecessary, the story is so stilted, and the whole set-up prior to the climax is just boring. Not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a Lifetime TV movie.

The pros are minor but save it from complete disaster. The ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension, some of the cast members do very well (a good example being Victor Garber as the kindly Thomas Andrews) but I think special mention should go to David Warner as the cruel valet, Spicer Lovejoy. Warner steals every scene he's in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply priceless.

Although it doesn't hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece, it's OK overall."

2009-09-17,juliasayswhaat,"Titanic was an amazing movie and although it was extremely long, it is definitely worth watching. Titanic is a very well written movie based on a true story. It is about a ship that sunk in the middle of the ocean, and barely anybody survived. It is a love story between two people, that ended sad. But the movie made you cry, laugh, smile. It had comedy, drama, love, and any other drama you could think of, it was amazing. I could watch this movie everyday because it never gets old. I think it is good for all ages, and at some point in all your lives, you should watch it. I didn't watch it until this year, and i don't know how i lived without seeing it. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic love story."
2009-09-07,AAdaSC,"The film starts with the search for a valuable diamond that is presumed to have been lost when the Titanic sank. An old survivor, Rose (Gloria Stuart) contacts the team who are searching through the Titanic on the ocean-bed. She sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio)........oh yeah...........the ship sinks........

I began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and I started to well up as the credits started and the film began! Although, I think it's a good film, I feel I should mention the following points. Its way too long - scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement. I thought that Kate Winslet as ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio were good in the lead roles but Kate was too much of a woman. She is meant to be a 16 year old. She was far too mature. This made Jack seem a bit too boyish for her, although his look is probably right considering that Kate is meant to be 16. Having said that, Winslet's facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling - she conveys the despair of the situation very well. She's also pretty good with an axe! I felt that DiCaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were good.

Thank goodness that the Titanic sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy."
2009-09-05,maxschrek5,"This is the best movie ever. The only movie that equals it is Back to the Future. All others fall flat compared to this flat. It should at least be somewhere on the top 250. But it's not. What's wrong with you people?! The only low part of the movie is the ""I'm Flying"" scene. I mean that scene was utterly pointless. Every thing else was great. The best scene was the dock scene at South Hampton. That just shows that James Cameron is great at over the top set designs. The whole pretty much proves that but that scene emphasizes it. Another great part of it is the uniqueness of it compared to other Cameron films. His other movies are just run-of-the-mill action movies (okay T.2 and Aliens were much better then his others but his other movies are cursed by this). Lets just hope Avatar can match up to this masterpiece."
2009-09-01,jasleen_kaur,"I have probably seen this movie so many times now, but it is still emotional to watch. It was pure genius to entwine history's most well known ship-sinking with a raw love story. Despite knowing it isn't completely true, you cannot help but think that it could've been one of many catastrophic stories within a catastrophic disaster. I believe the mere plot line kept faults in acting skills, etc so implicit that it is very hard to pick out any sort of fault. Acting skills overall were exceptional and cinematography leaves you awe-struck.

This combination has only made this film what it is today - top of the all time box-office around the globe, and it deserves it: a perfect masterpiece."

2009-08-11,mviedirctr,"This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.

I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.

I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.

People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.

The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time. This ought to be right up there in the ratings with Ben-Hur.

People have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating. That's my opinion. I don't care what anybody thinks about it, it is just out there. Like it or hate it, think twice on this movie before giving it a low rating.

15/10! That's what I believe."
2009-08-06,darin-wissbaum,"The special effects of this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie. The great Titanic slipping under the waves, the people staying aboard for as long as they can, the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship (Molly Brown for example), The Capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on. Most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold April night. Taken as that alone James Cameron's film is a masterpiece. You really feel like you are on the real Titanic with the people of the time. The problem I have with this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Say what you want but I feel he was mis-cast. He does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice, saying things like horse-^*@% and I know how the world works. In other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach. Kate Winslet is better in her role as Rose Bukater but I would have preferred a different actress. She plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up. The love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction. Granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to. In this case a cheesy love story. Aside from that this film pretty much works. I watched it for the story of the Titanic and the actions of the crew that night, and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster. Cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there. Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater seemed out of place...."
2009-08-03,barbaralgeorge,"This film is about a love triangle that happens on the Titanic. The Titanic, the ship of dreams, is also known as ""The Unsinkable"". Rose leaves her rich fiancé Caledon Hockley for this poor artist, Jack. However, the Titanic collides with an Iceberg and sinks on April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning. Surprisingly, Jack dies and Rose survives. Eighty-four years later, Rose tells the story about her life on Titanic to her grand daughter and friends and explains the first sight of Jack-how she fell in love and how they fought for survival.

The theme of the movie is that love is worth more than material things. Cameron uses real actors that some people believe is based on a true story. Written in 1912, the dialogue is appropriate for the time period. Located in the Atlantic Ocean, this movie was actually based on some real occurrences. The film's soundtrack made the movie more enjoyable, especially the song by Celine Dion ""My Heart Will Go On""."
2009-07-25,Freebird314,
2009-07-16,evanston_dad,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and cliché it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.

The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.

Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.

2009-07-12,Racina,"Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.

When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is ""wait a minute, you don't?"" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. ""The love story is too cheesy"" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.

And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.

Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.

I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.

I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.

I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events."
2009-07-12,sherow20,"The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.

Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.

The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!"
2009-06-20,Rufus-T,"The movie was about appreciating and treasuring the past, learn the lesson and be grateful of the kindness of those who crossed the path. We have two intersecting story, the Titanic and Rose. Titanic sunk by arrogant. Rose, the leading lady, revived through her spirit with the help of Jack, the leading man. The movie started in the present with the explorer digging the Titanic wreckage for treasure. We met the old Rose as she visited the explorers to help identify a drawing. she helped us worked our way into the past with the back story romance between her and Jack.

The young Rose who was unhappy with her routine life was an engaged socialite. Her engagement was forced upon by her mother. Jack was a poor wanderer who won his way onto Titanic. They met at the Titanic bow one a night when Rose was considering suicide.

Jack and young Rose took up much of the movie. Their story not only serve as the back story, but our tour guide of Titanic, to get our feel for Titanic before its fateful tragedy. Jack and Rose are two very uplifting people. I found their behavior interesting to watch. Jack is kind of representation of an everyday man, the many immigrants who landed in America in the early 1900s. He had a speech during a dinner, which he was invited to first class, covered it all.

Rose was tied down by tradition. Titanic, that is the people who own Titanic, was overwhelmed with arrogance. There was a struggle between the two extremes. She was saved by meeting half way with a sacrificial help of Jack. No drastic changes without some kind of sacrifice. The future of shipping is saved by the sinking of Titanic with the sacrifice of the victims.

As the story unfolded, the explorer understood that the Titanic is more than a gold mine. The audience understand the value of Titanic. The back story helped us understand the importance of Titanic to her and the symbolism of Titanic for the explorer. Basically, the movie took us to a meeting with the haunting ghost of the past.

The movie had many powerful lines about life, particularly from Old Rose and Jack. Old Rose has quotes about the past. Jack has quotes about living a life. The sinking scenes of Titanic was haunting. It was Jack and Rose take us to the moment for those got stranded waiting for the boat to return. After watching the movie, I felt I have gone through the experience of Jack and Rose and many other victims. I can't say that about the other Titanic movies.

Of course, even with great idea, the story won't work without the acting, the setting, the cinematography, and the music, which were all superb. Watching this movie was like I was on the Titanic maiden voyage.

It was a sad movie in one sense because of the disaster, but it was also a hopeful movie because of what a person can struggle through despite of a traumatic event in the past.

James Cameron had triumphantly raised the Titanic for everyone. He brought stardom to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who played Jack and Rose respectively. He also revived the classic age actress Gloria Stuart who played the Old Rose. With the success of this movie, he was able to spent time in the next 10+ years doing research in revolutionizing digital 3D. Hopefully in not distant future, he will be able to re-release this epic in glorious digital 3D."
2009-06-14,ametaphysicalshark,"It's not too hard to figure out what kept audiences flocking to ""Titanic"" when it came out. The sheer spectacle of it as well as the sweeping sense of romance which Cameron succeeds in evoking made this a 'must-see' theatrical experience. At the time and even for a while after, ""Titanic"" seemed like it would go down as an epic for the ages, a masterpiece with the overwhelming reputation of classic epics like ""Gone With the Wind"". The Oscar wins seemed to cement that.

Then came the backlash, which was inevitable for any film with this sort of popularity. The thing is, ""Titanic"", to some extent, deserved its backlash. It is obviously nowhere near as bad as some say, but viewed today, 12 years later, in a home setting away from the 'theatrical experience' many enjoyed back then, the movie's flaws are easily exposed. The screenplay is really not strong at all, the characters are more like caricatures, and the romance not particularly convincing. At most, during the excruciatingly long hour and some spent on set-up, this romance which Cameron seems to think is the epitome of romantic cinema, a love affair to match the scope of the film, seems like a cute fling. Jim Cameron's knack for writing some truly execrable dialogue is not gone just yet, and while I can knock back a beer or two (or seven) and watch Ripley lay waste to xenomorph after xenomorph in ""Aliens"" while cracking one-liners, it's a little hard to take in this setting. Still, most of the dialogue is solid or average, and there are some good lines. The narrative structure and momentum is nothing special at all- poor dude meets rich girl, they 'fall in love', Titanic hits the iceberg and then there's an hour of running here and there and special effects.

So the film was over-hyped, yes. Jim Cameron's previous films were all better, bar ""True Lies"" and his cheap debut feature ""Piranha 2"", but that doesn't mean ""Titanic"" doesn't have its positive points. It is obviously a wonderful technical achievement that still stands tall, is very nicely-shot, and there are a number of excellent scenes. Indeed, the sheer spectacle of the final hour and some, from the moment the ship hits that iceberg, is still easy to get carried away by, and Cameron proves that he is more than capable as a popcorn entertainer. DiCaprio is very charming and proves himself as a dramatic actor in the latter stages while Winslet does her typically annoying nonsense, but on the negative side Horner's score is pretty mediocre.

It's a good enough film, over-hyped yes but that is the fault of the public, not the film, which remains flawed but ultimately fairly enjoyable, on par or better than most big budget flicks and disaster movies, but it's no masterpiece, and now excuse me, I'm going to watch ""Aliens"" again."

2009-06-13,tburke85,"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch."

2009-06-03,TheLittleSongbird,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox."
2009-05-29,eddiez61,"Titanic sinks itself on technical, artistic and ethical reasons. Firstly, the script is horribly corny and tedious. Everyone speaks as though they're one day out of acting school, over-emoting even the simplest, most minor of thoughts. I never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars. For a 3+ hour movie, there's ridiculously little time spent on character development. And the shallow clichéd narration of the old lady gets extremely tedious.

Secondly, the effects do not hold up today, in 2011. You might say that's an unfair criticism, to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards. The effects, it turns out, are the only part I originally liked back in 1997. At that time I would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle. It now looks dated and awkward, and it's just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today.

Finally, and most importantly, the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ship's construction. There were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe, but neither the owners nor the public were concerned. The notion of being able to safely maneuver such a Leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men, but the Great Ship is presented as an unquestionably positive, glorious achievement. The film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chance—an act of nature, a freak accident, a stray iceberg—that downed the ship, and not ignorance, pride, hubris. As it is I was waiting eagerly for it's inevitable demise, I almost felt everyone deserved it. James Cameron should have gone down with his tremendous, beautiful beast.

And it certainly is beautiful. We are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks, sumptuous accommodations, and throbbing mechanical drives. The best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess, but Mr. Cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons. OK, so Leonardo and Kate are ""different"", but still they are deluded. Their only crime, perhaps, is their youth, so yes, their story is a tragedy. Their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image that's truly impressive, but there's no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast. It comes off as just a shallow, slick promotional ad for the cruise line.

My point is that I feel it's so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of man's superiority and divine place on Earth. We now know that such absurdly over-sized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many. And it's happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace. We are doomed if we stay the course, but ""Titanic"" celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way. By intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie, Mr. Cameron, and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial. It does not. It purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness. It is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies it's viewers to question any of it's splendor. I find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself. That's just so depressing, and so tragic in ways which James Cameron is apparently oblivious.

I feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter, not worthy of it's efforts and costs. We are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess. It's exactly this kind of consumption that is accelerating our ecological decline and inflicting extreme hardships on so many millions of disadvantaged people the world over. That's a very big heavy thought, for sure, but this massive movie is just asking for — demanding — this kind of consideration. Titanic omits the most important compelling bit of the story. The old lady's love may live on, but her planet is sinking..."

2009-05-21,k-dhesi,"The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a ""night to remember."" It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised? I have no idea. Could/will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.

The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting.

The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself ""TITANIC"" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great.

I guess it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (don't be surprised if you cry too)"
2009-05-04,shanvin2,
2009-04-15,ngogiathinh,"Wow, this is the most interesting that i have ever seen. What makes the movie unforgettable is not only the great story line but also the talented direction of James Cameron. To me, the time when Titanic went down under the freezing water was the climax of the movie. At that moment, the director did a great job in expressing the feeling of thousand souls fighting against the death.

The sinking scene appears to be extremely realistic and touching. Each action of each figure bears many implied meaning. They depict one true's identity when trying to survive. They have different actions. Aristocrats, who always hide their nature or act above others, they refuse to wear the life vests because of its informality. However, at the end, they cannot hide their fears or tears.

The musicians decide to play regardless of the chaos. Why? They want to be faithful with ""Music"", the source of their life. This is a very touching scene. This shows us great love in a different kind, a kind that is way above others: Love is beyond fears.

Yeah, i really recommend someone who haven't seen that movie should try to watch it. It is in top 100 movie you should watch in your life."
2009-04-13,PhuongNgo,"For those who cherishes the true love, Titanic is the greatest movie ever. Thanks to Director Cameron who casted the most wonderful romance and tragedy film that whenever I watch it over again, I always have a strong feelings of love and to be loved. The first time I watched Titanic, I almost focused and be amazed of the unsinkable Titanic. For some reason, I did not recognized the hidden message conveying throughout the film which were the meaning of freedom, the power of true love, the right to live, the trust in God, the price of an action and the devil inside anyone. It teaches me that even if a person can live in the richness and has power, it does not mean that person has freedom. A person actually has a freedom when he/she is himself/herself. Look at Rose when she joined the dancing party in the third-class desk, she enjoyed and felt free. The film also persuade me that when someone loves someone from their heart, there is no boundary that they cannot overcome. How Rose could leave behind the richness and how Jack gave his life to her were the meaning of how love works in this real life. Everyone has the right to live, no matter where they come from. A person can be the owner of the greatest building in this world while others have just a penny in their pocket, they have the same right to live this life and money can not steal that genius right from anyone else.Above all, I understand that every action a person makes always has its price and that person will be responsible for any decisions he makes. It really teaches me how to deal with important decisions in my life and help me to figure out how to be the good person and prevent me of nurturing the devil inside of me...Titanic is a good film to watch over and over again. There is sometime I lost the perception of what love is, I watch it and I know that there is somewhere on this earth, someone can give another one his/her life...like Jack!"
2009-04-06,lopcar1993,"some movies don't live up to their hype, some don't even live up to be movies. But this; this one does that and so much more. James Cameron's Titanic tells the story of Jack Dawson a poor and down on his luck painter who scores tickets for passage on the ""Unsinkable"" Titanic, there he meets Rose Dewitt Bukator. Rose is traveling to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob of a fiancée Caledon ""Cal"" Hockley, and on the way the two become fast friends and soon fall in love. For those of you who have heard the story or haven't heard of it at all this is the movie to watch. All be it it's not a hundred percent accurate but it does well with telling the tragic story of the titanic. The Titanic is a monumental achievement of film making at it's best and also one of the highest grossing film's of all time, It's a beautiful film with great heart and soul; you feel every emotion that's in the film love, joy, angry, sorrow ,fear and anguish. Titanic is a romantic film that no other in the genre can follow or surpass, it's an amazing love story and tear jerker all rolled up into one. James Cameron creates a beautiful and breathtaking scenery and magnificent special effects in a film to end all film's. Titanic is one of the greatest film's ever made and will continue to inspire people to believe in fate, and in love."
2009-03-31,devindrreuter,"I have made the goal of seeing all of the films on the top 250 many deserving to be on the list, and in my opinion some not. I has shocked to see Titanic was not on this list. this is the reason why the 250 can lose some validity when people say the movies on the list are not the 'best' movies. now I understand some films are fan boy films and cult films. I beg all users to vote for ten stars for a movie that not only should be on the list but in the top twenty five if not the top ten(Dark Knight wasn't that great) this film has one the most Oscars than any other film(tied for 1st in a three way tie) Vote Ten Maybe I'm just a huge JC fan but this film needs to be on top 250"
2009-03-27,AshCaton,"This is not a groundbreaking film. This is not even an informative film. Instead it is an ordinary, clichéd, love story set on a boat. It looks gorgeous, it's very well acted, it's only failing is in it's false premise. This is not a film about the Titanic. This I found incredibly irritating as I was desperate for more focus on what was going on anywhere else but with Jack and Rose. What is most ridiculous is that the film even makes point of introducing the Captain and other historically accurate characters, only to ignore them until the climax. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are both very capable actors and I think they tackle Rose and Jack admirably, in other hands they could have been very cringe-worthy indeed. For me, the most interesting part of this film is Bill Paxton and his mates going to examine the ship in present day. The rest of the story descends into a bloated, overly sentimental blur of over dramatic emotions as Billy Zane suddenly goes loony and Celine Dion's heart goes on and on and on... Literary critics said in 1912 that it took a vast amount of human vanity to create the Titanic, and now it took another huge dollop to make this movie. I didn't cry. Neither will you."

2009-03-19,jmzkeenan,"It's interesting to see the extreme opinions (pro or con) expressed here about Titanic, ranging from those who feel it's the greatest story ever told to those who feel it's the worst travesty ever produced in Hollywood. I don't agree with either – I feel that Titanic is a somewhat run-of-the-mill movie that wasn't worthy of the vast amount of hype it generated, but can still provide an evenings entertainment (albeit with some employment of the fast forward button). I can supplement my review with contemporary impressions from first seeing the movie in 1998, taken from an email cum movie review written to a friend of mine in a distant corner of the world who hadn't seen the movie yet. (Extracts from this email are in quotes).

First, the good stuff. I loved the efforts that Cameron made (either through sets, or through CGI) to reproduce the look of the RMS Titanic, as well as re-enacting the sinking:

""Verdict on Titanic: The staging of the ships interiors and exteriors are stunningly realistic -- damn near perfect is more like it. Obviously, a great deal of effort was made to get things down pat.""

It was also very interesting to see the underwater film that Cameron really shot on the wreck of the Titanic – much better than the film shot for the Imax documentary Titanica. This underwater film, the interiors, and the digital depictions of the Titanic underway are enough to make the film worth watching all by itself.

Regrettably, with the good comes the bad. I've always felt that the biggest strike against the movie is the cliché love story between the two star-crossed lovers:

""Unfortunately, a good chunk of the film is the so-called 'love story'. This portion of the story, starring this year's pretty boy, is Hollywood cliché from start to finish. 'Poor little rich girl' meets poor but honest travelers/artist aboard the Titanic. She's travelling in 1st class with her beastly fiancée and assorted evil, stuck up, snobbish, rich capitalist/oligarch pigs. He's travelling 3rd class with the salt of the earth immigrants. Think for a few minutes and write up a list of 10 Hollywood clichés that come to mind. I guarantee that 75% of them are in the film.

The real story of the Titanic and its passengers is story enough, in my opinion -- the love story wasn't needed. I assume that it was added to add some uncertainty to the story. Hollywood should have learned from Apollo 13 that just because the audience knows the end of the story doesn't mean you can't make a good movie of it. In any case, the 'love story' adheres so much to cliché that it can be mapped out with uncanny accuracy after ~ five minutes anyway.""

The only thing I would retract from my 1998 email is the comment about DiCaprio being ""this year's pretty boy"" – I've subsequently seen some of his other work, and I think that he can be a decent actor. I actually own Titanic on DVD (purchased cheap), and I watch it occasionally. But I do so with ample use of the fast forward button.

I've sometimes wondered what someone could do with a ""Phantom Edit"" of Titanic – could they edit Jack and Rose out of the film almost entirely, and just leave a decent semi-documentary account of the sinking?"
2009-03-18,Teddy-ITC,"The movie is an unbelievable fantastic lovestory.

The famous actor appeared an actor and an actress in the movie.

The movie is based on reality.

The name of the vessel is Titanic, and has two main characters, a male and female.

He loves her and he won her love.

So they fell in love with each other.

The Titanic suffered a unfortunate destruction and was broken by an iceberg.

He tried to rescue her.

But the attempt was a failure. So they are together died.

I want to experience romantic love but I don't want to die."
2009-03-17,johnno-17,"I find it hard to believe people are still spending money to see this. The clichés, the glitz, the kitsch are enough to make one choke - like some plastic Madonna designed as a back-drop to a Wagnerian opera by Walt Disney on a Sterno binge. But the real flaw is that it just goes on and on, milking every possible tear from the eyes of deluded teenagers who read one historical 'romance' novel too many.

I don't even know why I watched it through the end - except it was on cable, and a documentary on the real Titanic tragedy was immediately scheduled after. (Watching it free is the only way to see this wretched excess without giving the studio hacks behind it the wrong idea, that it might have been worth making - it wasn't.) Anyway, I thought the people freezing took an awful long time going to meet their maker. But perhaps they were waiting to meet the maker of this movie, who obviously took a vacation during the corporate filming of it. Needed extra time to count the money from the suckers, doncha know....

A complete travesty of anything like real historical drama."
2009-03-07,Tricky74,"I've now seen this film several times, and it does get better. I promise! The first time, I must confess, I found it laughable! The problem was that, at times, it appears to present itself as a documentary-which it is not! It is an epic love story which happens to be set upon the Titanic, that is all-and there is nothing wrong with that. There are some good performances and room in the story for some engaging character development. There are also great special effects and plenty of action scenes, to keep your pulse up. So, in summary-if it's historical accuracy you seek then rent a documentary, if you want an absorbing (if rather drawn out) love story you could do worse."
2009-03-03,CandidlyCandid,"Titanic holds 11 Oscars, the highest every grossing movie of all time and a critically acclaimed cinematic masterpiece. It took the world by storm in 1997 and still values plenty of positive credit to this day. To me, Titanic is no masterpiece, its a fictional love story on a real-life tragedy that struck in the youth years of the 20th century. Keep in mind there is terrific acting, excellent use of CGI and effects and some very suspenseful scenes not to mention the grueling emotions throughout the movie. Titanic created and extorted many famous memorable scenes to be remembered dearly in the future of the movie business. James Cameron directs a fine romantic movie, that was executed fantastically. The history, design and 'feel' was all accurate and that's one strong element that all other past Titanic movies didn't have. A fine movie with exquisite acting and detailed cinematography."

The effects are phenomenal in this film. The Titanic looks as how it should have and looks real. They really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawless.

Some of the scenes in this film are just awesome. Especially the scene where the Titanic hits the Iceberg. THe whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivated.

Acting is good for the most part. DiCaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but I really have not seen that many of his films. Same with Kate Winslett. Actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding. I thought the captain of the Titanic was well performed as were the entire crew of the Titanic.

Music is spectacular. Not much more to add.

This is a really good film. Not a ten out of ten for me but a solid nine out of ten and a film that I highly recommend to the likely two people out there that have never seen it."
2009-02-16,Beta_Gallinger,"As I'm sure you know, this was a HUGE hit back when it was in theatres, turning out to be the highest grossing movie of all time, but as hard as it may be to believe, I've finally seen it for the first time, over eleven years later! I was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success, and yes, I did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was. I was also soon familiar with the famous song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by the greatly despised Celine Dion. Still, I never actually saw the movie for over a decade. Shortly before finally watching it, I knew that despite its popularity, it has also been widely ridiculed. So, it wouldn't have surprised me if I wasn't very impressed at all, but that didn't exactly turn out to be the case.

84 years after the sinking of the Titanic, a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ship's wreckage. A TV report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named Rose Calvert, who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture! She then goes with her granddaughter, Elizabeth, to visit the team. Although they are skeptical, the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912, when she was Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich teenager aboard the Titanic, believed to have gone down with the ship! She tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named Jack Dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt, and how this led to conflict between Rose and her family and oafish fiancée Caledon Hockley.

Several months ago, I watched ""Pearl Harbour"", and it seemed that some people compared that film to ""Titanic"", which I thought was not good. As a result, I was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie, the first of the two. Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90's parts of the film. When the acting isn't poor, it's basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren't portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6/10, but even that part isn't perfect.

I know this is a widely loathed movie. I'm also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she's from my country. (Mind you, I think ""My Heart Will Go On"" is the only song in her catalogue I've ever heard more than once, and I couldn't even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in ""The Invisible Man"", which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of ""Titanic"" thoroughly inaccurate? I'm sure it is, so don't watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It's a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn't worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent. I'm not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen ""Pearl Harbour"" first, but now that I've seen them both, I do think ""Titanic"" is pretty good in comparison."
2009-02-14,neohypofilms,"The Great Thing to remember is this....they're many great epics out there that will hold up over the generations. It will take the education and guidance of film scholars and revival cinemas to preserve the true masterpieces. ""Titanic"", was meant to be and will always be remembered as 90's over-hyped fluff for the teen masses and over 50 year old that wanted a slice of old school Hollywood romance on the big screen. It is, what it is. The film is already dated. For true romantic epics, check out ""El Cid"", or ""Dr. Zhivago"". In closing, there's more to great epics than pretty faces and special effects. One day the masses will wake up and know a truly great film after its initial release. A Great film will hold up for decades. Immediate big box office does not mean long term classic or masterpiece. Titanic is far from either."
2009-02-11,andrewtowne-1,"I loved this movie.

It has everything -- romance, tragedy, comedy, suspense, action, adventure, acute social commentary -- and is extremely well crafted.

Many movies try to do everything and fail. This movie tries to do everything and succeeds beautifully. Better than that, it is greater than the sum of its remarkable parts. And it is hard to get better than that.

Those who are -- with I admit a lot of justification -- cynical about big Hollywood productions might not ever accept what I am saying.

But being closed-minded is not the same as being clever. Not every low-budget ""art"" or independent film is great; neither is every big-budget production from Hollywood bad.

""Titanic"" not only isn't bad, I am confident that it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever made.

Let's begin with Leonardo DiCaprio. He is in a class by himself as an extraordinarily good looking young man who is not just a pretty boy, but who can really act. He was riveting in ""The Basketball Diaries."" He is no less outstanding in ""Titanic."" I have never seen an actor showing such range -- from drug addicted athlete to romantic lead -- in such a short period of time. Clearly, the only thing that can hold DiCaprio back is a bad script.

This leads me to my next key point: ""Titanic"" is very well written. There is not a single false note in the writing, and the plotting is very tight with no holes that I can see. It all fits neatly and plausibly together -- which is rare both in novels and in movies.

I could go on, praising the other actors, the direction, the special effects, etc., but I think I've made my overall point.

This is not just some over-blown pseudo-romance featuring depth-less and soul-less ""beautiful people.""

It makes me proud that Americans can still create great art -- even in Hollywood."

2009-01-26,long-ford,"On a recent viewing of Titanic, I realized that some of the Special Effects now look slightly dodgy. Still, the bulk of the film holds up very well. The beginning is a bit slow as the older Rose narrates her story. Bill Paxton is wasted in a thankless part. Leo and Kate's tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though. They absolutely convinced me they were in love. Once the ship strikes the iceberg, the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch. Titanic remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heart-breaking romance.

Overall 9/10"

2008-12-07,insomniac_rod,"I watched this movie on theaters 11 years ago, around December or January 1st. 1998, I can't remember.

All I can remember is that everybody watched it twice or even more times on the theaters while it was enough for me to watch it once.

The plot is directed only for girls or guys who HAVE to go with their girlfriends in order to get laid or something.

The situations are romantic oriented and nothing more. The soundtrack is catchy but that's it and the f/x are really spectacular but nothing you haven't seen.

Still, this is a perfect romantic movie that will have your girlfriend crying and hugging you.

Everybody hates it because it's filled with clichés but on it's time it was extremely popular that everyone had to watch it to comment about it.

Nowadays, it's just looks like a Hallmark production."
2008-12-01,alshehri,"TITANIC is great combination of romance ,drama and comedy .it won eleven academy awards. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet lighted up the screen as the young lovers (the poor artist Jack Dawson and the first class girl Rose)their journey becomes struggle to survive after the ship hits into an ice burg with no enough life boats.

James Horner creates the best music ever .the production is perfect . Cameron deserves all the respect for writing , producing and directing the movie.

2008-11-09,Hines150,"This film should of never won best picture. This was just a glamorized version of pretty women. Special effects were good in this movie and deserved any awards that they got. But if you look at the other films that year like L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good As it Gets. Those are original films that deserved the best picture award. I don't know how anyone can watch L.A. Confidential and not wonder why that film did not win best picture. Good thing the acting in Titanic did not win any awards because there were about one hundred better performances that year before you get to the first one in Titanic. James Cameron is overrated. Yes the terminator films were classics, but Curtis Hanson really should of got the award for Best Director."
2008-11-02,jeha-2,"The film Titanic is absolutely awesome, every last minute of it, and James Cameron did everything right. The whole film seems so realistic and you really feel for Rose (Kate Winslet), who I thought looked gorgeous throughout the whole movie, and has a fiery personality and vast intelligence. I also loved Leo DiCaprio's character of Jack as the traveling starving artist and helps Rose realize her dreams that she thinks she'll never be able to achieve. I love how realistic everything was, including the beautifully done vintage costumes, hairstyles and sets, which make you feel like you're really there. The production team got the sinking of the ship quite accurately according to history, and that was fantastic that they did research so diligently. This movie is fantastic and deserves all the recognition that it has received over the years."

This is the best movie i've EVER seen. what this film is about is Jack (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) how wins tickets in a card game and then meets a girl on the ship, named Rose (played by Kate Winslet) who tries to jump of the end of the ship. She is saved by Jack and they fall in love, but rose is going to be wed. This film is good because it runs with a nice flow and exiting. Some of the best parts are when you see the water bursting throw the walls. Now if you don't like sad films DON'T WATCH THIS FILM it is sad. Some of the saddest parts are when you see every body floating in the water, and when you see the woman not wanting to go in the lifeboat without their husbands. And if you don't like romance movies don't watch this, but if you do then watch it. Now for my finale rating 10/10, but thats not all I think that this film should be listed on the IMDb top 250 but it is not anyway i hope that you like this film. But you may not"
2008-10-03,srinath_p1988,This is an awesome movie of all times.I wonder why this movie is not even in top 250.It deserves a much better place in the ratings.The ultimate love story of all times.This is one of the best movies i have ever seen.The tear which it brings out of your eyes is the movie's success.A must watch for everyone.The special effects are also good.The acting is excellent.It never seemed like 3 hours watching this movie.It made me go into the movie.Words are not enough to explain about TITANIC.If you have not watched the movie yet you have been missing a great movie.Watch it right now.This is the most romantic love story i have ever seen.I give it 10 out of 10.
2008-09-30,sschlenker,"I'll start with the good in this movie- the production design and some of the supporting acting.

Now the bad- pretty much everything else

Everyone says, no, you've got it wrong because it's truly beautiful. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I am a film lover who does like touching, beautiful dramas. I'm not some guy who sits around criticizing movies. But this is just disturbing. The message of this film is basically ""Americans can fall for soap-opera material that looks like a movie, and it can become the most overrated piece of trash of all time"". I mean seriously, it's just a really shallow and overly-touchy love story with really obnoxious tendencies to take itself waaayy to seriously. Honestly, James Cameron directed Terminator 2, which I thought was really fun and enjoyable because though it had a coherent story, it was purposely far-fetched and seemed to understand that. Titanic is three-and-a-half hours of pain-inducing mediocrity (except for the previously mentioned design), with completely over-the-top sappiness and the cheapest tricks in the book as far as getting a simple-minded audience to feel really tingly inside. And this won 11 Academy Awards? I've got a review for the only other movie to achieve this feat, Return of the King, which I didn't like either, but I've got to say it was better than this. My only question is, why, America? Why does crap like this become so acclaimed? I think the reason this won all those Oscars was its popularity. And why is it so popular?

In conclusion, Titanic is a bad episode of Days of Our Lives with a little spicing-up of the visuals and a little more emotional manipulation. But it amounts to what should have been a little blip on the radar that everyone understood as mediocrity. Instead people consider this ""art"" and ""beautiful, powerful, compelling"". So the only productive thing this movie has really done is to show us that America has pretty low tastes in entertainment, and seems to think that it's somehow artistic."
2008-09-28,robertofuiano,"beautiful film. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. For edward shossor hand 7.6. SHAME: This is masterpiece of Hollywood. 11 Oscar for a poor 7.2!!! Shame."
2008-09-28,RMS1949,"Because IMDb has too many fanboys who think Batman should be the top rated film of all-time, movies like Titantic will never succeed here. Great storytelling, a historical background, good acting, excellent directing, great special effects and a beautiful soundtrack.. Titantic won all those Oscars and is the highest grossing film of all-time. I don't think anyone involved with it will lose any sleep on how it's rated at this site. I loved it when it came out and still watch it a lot.. It's the type of film that makes being a movie fan a joy. It's film making at it's best and no moron trying to put it down will ever change that."
2008-09-13,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,"From James Cameron , the director of Aliens. Thats all i needed to hear to know i was going to see Titanic. Without a doubt one of the best love stories i have seen in a long time. All of this was very attractive. Great director, great cast, a Romeo and Juliet style love story and a hand full of positive reviews. Even though it was good i still don't see why it made over a billion dollars. I saw it and couldn't see what the deal was all those years ago.

Leo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet lead the fine cast. Both had chemistry and gave us a romantic love story. Both give great performances and were great choices.

I recommend it but don't expect much. It was good but not that good. Had a great cast and great love story but that is all thats here. If your looking for a good love story watch this or the notebook.

6/10"
2008-09-11,lambsarepets,"I really don't understand why people hate Titanic. On a pure technical level, it was groundbreaking, the span and width of an epic film was faceted in this film. There's a reason why it won 11 Academy Awards and is still the most grossing film unadjusted for inflation. If movie tickets had been the same price as it was in 1997/98, The Dark Knight would have to make $900 million dollars to catch up to the amount of tickets Titanic sold.

The success of Titanic was not because of schoolgirls fawning over a story of lost love. That is a delusion. When people think of Titanic now, they feel embarrassed because they fell in love with the movie when it came out, but now, for some reason, deem it too corny. It deserves everything and anything it got, award and money-wise.

82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, yet an incredibly unfair 7.2 on IMDb. James Cameron fans know that both his dream projects Battle Angel (2010?) and Avatar (2009) would have never come in to fruition if it wasn't for Titanic.

Titanic is big, bold, touchingly uncynical film-making. Was it the acting that made it fail? No. Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are doing mighty fine in terms of their careers. Was it the story? Old-fashioned story-telling was the highlight of many top critics, according to RT. And to many people, though they may be reluctant to say it, had their tear ducts on full mode at the end of the movie.

Watch it again, and this time without your preconceived bias and prejudice. Watch it with a clean slate, and you will realize that the talk is really just.. talk.

Till the day I die, I will defend this incredibly clever, classy and colossal piece of epic cinema. I can't bear to see it wither away like this.

Titanic will forever be in my top movies list."
2008-09-10,kyle-cruse,"When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make ""Titanic"" as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. ""Good Will Hunting"" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song ""My Heart Goes On,"" definitely worthy of its Oscar.

*** out of ****"
2008-08-30,AttilaD87,"The movie is a total perfection. When it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had. Maybe The Lord Of The Rings ,maybe not :), that movie is another greatness of the film-making.

Coming back too Titanic with the record $1,835,300,000 Worldwide Box Office that is still no.1 after 11 years is amazingly great.

I cannot understand the users of IMDb because this movie is not in the top 250 movies . That is shame ,this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250. A movie at least 8-9 out of 10 ,IMDB USERS!!! Wake Up and see the movie again because you seen something else. I cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where Titanic is not included.

The movies prior theme beside the ship's history is the greatest human feeling: love what is universal and timeless. The picture presents us the meaning of true love. Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.

Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life. We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever.

With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements. James Horner's soundtrack is simply beautiful and completely matches with the movie ,there is no surprise that his soundtrack album has been sold with 30 million copy's

The movie is the greatest achievement in cinema ,it is the top of the pyramid..."

I hate people who give 10/10 for 'The Chain Saw Massacre'. Those same people see Titanic has a failure but The Chain Saw Massacre has a masterpiece. Come on! Cameron and his crew made a success with Titanic.

Titanic was not meant to be a documentary... but only a MOVIE with a love story. And it's a great one... even if the characters are fictitious. I just loved Kathy Bates in her small role... and I loved hating the bad guy, Billy Zane.

2008-08-15,dom_nick90,"After reading all the posted comments, it left me wondering why this film so underrated after all the huge success.i wish i could be in 1997 to feel it. Some people are too serious when judging this film. I'd watched this film for the first time in 2005 but simply love it. I loves the plot although its quite long but it's paid after watching the great ship finally sink. Think a minute, how this film becomes so famous if it is too boring and awful too watch? Give a break!

I really think that it deserved that 11 Oscar awards. It's a expensive movie ever made with excellent actors and actresses an with equally good romance story. Sadly, too many people put too offensive comments over this not-so-bad movie. After all, it is the biggest hits ever...still, NO movies could ever beat Titanic."

It hits every emotion the human body can produce, and then some. It bleeds through your mind and heart, the moment the film starts. It has the perfect mixture of love, romance, tragedy, humor, excitement, and adventure, without exploiting or going over the top. This film showcases love can withstand anything, and will break through barriers big or small, and has a very unique message that says their is beauty and happiness through great tragedy, and that heartbreak and loss can only make you stronger. The film is epic, and has beautiful cinematography, with lush costumes, Oscar worthy performances, breathtaking special effects, a very universal story that any country could understand, and has a score that not only sound gorgeous, but contributes to the story. Through out my life their are very few films that stick out, and remind me of the very first time I saw that movie, on a scale from one to ten, this would be a twenty. And is one of the three films to receive eleven Oscars, major ones including Best Picture, Director, Editing, Score, Special Effects, and Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Sound Effects, Sound, Song, and received three nominations, including Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and Best Makeup."

2008-08-06,yeshuamyking77,"An absolutely terrific film. I saw it when it first came out in the theater and loved it. Breathtaking, romantic, epic and terribly sad.

My only gripe with the film is the ending. Granted, I understand it makes more dramatic sense for Jack to die, but the reason he dies is so stupid. He tries to get on the door with Rose and it starts to sink. So, he gallantly allows her to stay on the door while he freezes to death in the Atlantic.

Um ... could you try balancing on either end? Here Rose, you sit on this end, and I'll sit on the other. Let's just try it. Maybe it won't work, but it's better than prying my dead, frozen hands off the door at the end of the film. Or hey, maybe I'll swim around for a few minutes and see if I can find another piece of debris to float on. It's just dumb that neither of these options occur to them.

Again, I get the reasons why, for the story's sake, Jack must die. It just doesn't make any sense outside the dramatic impetus.

Otherwise, terrific film. I could see it again and again without getting tired of it."
2008-08-04,FelixEbner,"Terrific film-making which works on different planes.

Director/writer, James Cameron gives us a beautiful love story. The mix of all of the characters are engrossing.

Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson does a great job, and this actor is looking grown up. Beautiful and talented, Kate Winslet as Rose, looks like she came from the past. Kathy Bates (""Misery"") as Molly Brown, the brash American 'new money' socialite. Billy Zane as Rose's controlling fiancé does a great job at being despicable. Frances Fisher matches the rest of the cast with her talent.

The special effects are fantastic and they never overpower the story. And the music and title song are haunting.

I've heard that Cameron was difficult to work with. Not to excuse that, but sometimes, when one has a vision, it comes across that way. In the end, it seems that his vision was realized?"
2008-08-02,mukava991,"James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.

Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.

The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple: unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancé of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.

Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.

One implausibility: The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.

A CGI flaw: Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.

The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.

And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly ""Our Love Will Go On,"" a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.

Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is ""Titanic: The Legend Lives On"" (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron's movie. It will stay with you for a long time."
2008-08-01,ahmad_phoenixfly,"This move was one if the best I have seen do far.

The Sound Track, The acting, The Script....everything just fitted like a jig-saw puzzle. The Outcome..?...Absolute perfection! I mean Kate Wilson acted beautifully...same goes for Leonardo DiCaprio. Their chemistry was astonishing. The directer did awesome takes of the sinking. He made it sad...Yet Horrifying..He showed us the true picture. He showed the atmosphere which was intense and hopeless. He showed it exactly what it must have been at the time of sinking. All in all...this is one of the greatest movies ever made and which I can still not forget to mention between great movies after even twenty years or so.

This was an unforgettable movie!! 10/10...And I don't care what people say."
2008-07-20,jacksparrow88,"When i first saw this movie i didn't like it, maybe because i was too young to understand it.

But when i saw it again a few weeks ago i was blown away. The special effects are amazing. Even after so long ago it's still right up their with the rest. James Cameron has made great movies (aliens, the terminator/2, the abyss) and this is one of his best.

All the actors do a good job. The leading characters a people you want to fallow and you want them to make it.

It's funny to see that the movie only gets a 7.2 while it made over 1.8 billion and it won 11 Oscars. For me it's a 10 and 5 stars

Great job Cameron and a must see."
2008-07-19,kak93,"I found this movie to be absolutely wonderful! It is my number one favorite movie. All of my friends know it. Whenever i bring it up, they make fun of me. My brother and dad mock the characters for repeating Jack and Rose's names so many times. In my opinion though, they did not give this movie a chance.

It is a beautiful love story! The historic details in the movie are also fairly accurate. I have seen this movie many times and can quote word for word during about 85% it. That is how much i love it. I recommend it to anyone who loves 2 watch a good love story a love story."

2008-07-04,dfle3,"After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.

In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the ""Titanic"") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).

When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think ""Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!"". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!

Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.

A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.

Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Jack""). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.

Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.

Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.

P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan ""Down among the dead men"". It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube."
2008-07-01,segustafson,"I finally, finally broke down to watch this (I know, I know, it took some time to do it) and now I know why it took me so long. My Lord, this sorry excuse for a movie is just plain awful. I haven't experience this much movie-viewing pain since trying to sit through Brokeback Mountain, another highly overrated, badly acted, sorry excuse of time and effort. Sappy dialog, boring, over-the-top characters, dull and predictable storyline, and so on and so on. The costume designs, set decorations, cinematography, and special effects were definitely worthy of notice, but nothing else. And to realize that this worthless piece of trash won the Best Picture Oscar over L.A. Confidential, a brainy, stylish, police drama, is unbelievably pathetic. But then again, I have noticed that most of the viewing public, including critics and Hollywood, don't like to think too much. In that case, this movie's for you!"
2008-06-25,pac_lov_rspct,"i loved this movie it was so good i just loved it and had to own it on DVD. cassette. DVD, platinum edition, special edition, directors cut. Leonardo DiCaprio is a very good actor, i enjoy his work, i enjoyed his work. I enjoy his work because his not like other actors who are like the same character in movies,, but he's acting chooses do change. And I don't know of another actress who could have played the role of Rose as Kate Winslet did. I also don't remember being bored of watching this movie. My first time watching it, when i was young, I do remember my folks taking me to the picture and I didn't know what was going to happen next, but it made you wonder. And unlike other 'Titanic' movies, this movie makes you want go and meet the director, James Cameron. As I watch movies, sometimes in my head I'll be like, the camera would have gotten a better picture of the set if i had been placed at a different angle. And for Titanic (1997) i did this maybe twice. I recommend all of you watching it if you haven't already!!!"

2008-06-20,vic-232,"So, how do you spend vast amounts of money on a film and still wind up with a dreadful (albeit profitable) end product? Simple.

You spend lots of money on beautiful sets and breathtaking special effects. You hire some very talented and/or (mostly or) attractive actors. Then you give those actors lines to speak that are so badly written they might have been written by a 13-year-old girl trying to emulate a Harlequin romance.

Despite wonderful production values and a serviceable story line, ""Titanic"" may be painful to the ears of anybody who is fully literate. Why did James Cameron spend so many millions to make a film and not spend an extra ten grand to have a competent editor look at his script? Writing the ""Terminator"" movies really was NOT adequate preparation for writing an epic romance.

Gag me with a spoon! (Hmmm... did Kate Winslet's character say something like that in what was supposed to be 1912? Quite possibly!)"
2008-06-18,dhawaltrivedi,"All right to start with i am giving TITANIC 10 stars just for the fact that it touched my heart, and inspired me that - TO LIVE IS TO LOVE. TITANIC might not be technically flawless (as if we have any movie like this!! n yea including GODFATHER i mean)

its just that people LOVE to HATE titanic(for reasons unknown to me). this is also partly proved by the fact that this movie has (i guess) the HIGHEST no of comments written (2100 odd) .. you wouldn't find that for any pinky-ponky film .. i mean y would so many people bother to vote/comment about the film if they hated it so much (there are so much disastrous cinema these days !!)

well i wouldn't scribe much about the technical stuff since the Oscars stand firm as the proof of that. still here's my take on the technical aspects:

->DIRECTION is quite incredible. tackling such a huge production and a historic disaster is never easy. minus a few goofs the direction would have been perfect .. its great none-the-less

->the PERFORMANCES of the cast just blew me away. the casting seems perfect and kate winslet was out of this world .. leo seemed a bit raw in few scenes but his very charm on-screen was more than compensating

->set decoration/art direction was best i've seen along with LOTR

->BACKGROUND SCORE is DAMNNNNNN PERFECT .... JAMES HORNER take a bow !!!

->screen-writing was good too(yes inspite of the length of the film)

and EDITING seemed MIND-BLOWING(Oscar deserving) ->cinematography/sound/drowning sequences were all BREATH-TAKING

what could have been done better was(yes,there's always scope for improvement) :

->Leo was good but could've done bit better towards the end of the film ->few goof-ups in direction were avoidable ->screenplay lacked just a little punch towards the middle

above every damn thing - the ROMANCE B/W JACK and ROSE is the most incredible ever captured on screen(at par with casablanca)

i just don't understand why a lot of Americans hate this film(thats what we perceive here in India) .. but TITANIC is the biggest Hollywood BLOCK-BUSTER ever in India ... i engrossed my 8 year old cousin and my 65 year old grand-pa .. a rare feat for any film !!!!

FINALLY

TITANIC IS ONE MOVIE THAT CAN CAPTURE YOUR HEART AND MIND IN A WAY THAT YOU CANT EVEN IMAGINE ... IT MIGHT BE FICTION (some call it stupid-sob-fiction, but thats OK!!) .. BUT, LOVE IT OR HATE IT, TITANIC CANT BE IGNORED !!!!!!!

CHEERS AND PEACE !!! with love from India Dhawal Trivedi"

James Cameron did a fantastic job of bringing the TITANIC back to life so we all could see. Wonderful cast, wonderful story. Very sad ending, as we all know. I have seen all the TV movies with Barbara Stanwick, and others. No other movie tops this one. Kudos to Mr. James Cameron for having the sight to bring this movie back to life in the 1990's. A 10 for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know that Rose and Jack were added for the love story, and wonderful acting between them. The ship was identical to all the documentary's I have seen, especially the state rooms were the first class were staying. Again, this movie is a must see for all that have not watched as of yet.

2008-05-20,kbgnphillips,"'Titanic' is an excellent film by director James Cameron, and is a timeless classic. Titanic is very historically-accurate, yet the movie itself is also amazing. Kate Winslet stars as Rose, a spoiled rich 17-year-old girl who rides on the Titanic with her first class mother. Rose fall in love with a boy named Jack (Leonardo DiCapprio), to her mother's (and her fiancée's) great disapproval. The end is tragic and heartbrEaking, yet beautiful. Winner of Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1997, 'Titanic' is a true masterpiece, and will be enjoyed by anyone who watches it.

Rating: PG-13 for disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality, and brief language; 14A (CAN)"
2008-05-16,Dragoneyed363,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.

The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.

While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it. Underrated, powerful, breath-taking movie that, since holding up in quality on every watch, I intend to love for many more years to come."
2008-05-16,deathrattle,"Have to just applaud boyo-2's comment there, it is a bizarre film this indeed.

I personally hate it, but if its on then I will watch it until the end, a true enigma of the film world.

For the trashy love story that goes on, there are enough pure heartfelt moments in the film to make u have some understanding of the tradegy that occurred.

You can never call this a bad film, just not what I for one, was expecting.

And lets be honest, I think James Cameron knows what he is doing, he will go far that boy!!"
2008-05-12,zhangbei06090722,"Although Titanic is a movie first shown nearly ten years ago, but it seems never out of fashion. Even today, a great number of people approach it everyday, to recall that classical scenes, to understand the film from a totally different perspective.

The society is developing, but people's pursuit of romance is permanent. Especially nowadays, with the high divorce rate, people's desire for true love is much stronger than before. The love between Rose and Jack is so holy, so sparking, moved nearly everyone to tears. May be that's one of the reasons why it is so classical.

Once more the song of My Heart Will Go On rang in my mind. Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime. No more words can better describe the essence of this excellent movie."

2008-05-09,emperor_bender,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime.

""The most compelling movie of the century"". That's a joke.

My question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You're WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"", I'm willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.

This movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn't like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I'm being biased, but I really did not like this ""garbage"".

Don't get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I'm sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.

If you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Titanic"" is what you want.

2008-05-06,mike_MJ,"James Cameron, as is well known, stood firm not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of Titanic begs the question - had he not been lauded, would he have kept it real anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Cameron was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of Roger Hargreave’s most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Oxford/Cambridge boat race with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, Titanic also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Cameron hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning sink-age-isms as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to Titanic expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, Titanic has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. Titanic comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but Titanic is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it."
2008-05-03,giuseppelospalluti,"Caspita not even know how to attack this masterpiece of film. A paltry 7.1 to a masterpiece of its kind, is a real offense to cinema. This film deserves a full 10! For you more a film is dated the most affected, which is why I do not take into account the music and film reviews that are available on the Web. Now it also attacks the romantic film, who has never had a woman, it is clear that attacks this film. It 'definitely one of the most beautiful films ever shot, a dream from start to finish. I see Leonardo DI Caprio a great actor, very expressive and convincing. This film has moved many people and distance of many years if the rived still leaves me upset and sad. It 'definitely a masterpiece of cinema, there's nothing to do. The reconstruction of the Titanic is perfect, the characters are in full captains and real characters that were real Titanic. Usually sentimental films, have a great success: Ghost, Topgun, Gone with the wind, are all films with great success. useless this wonderful film will remain so forever."
2008-04-27,pheluda,"The first time I happened to watch Titanic (the movie), I was barely into my teenage years and barely out of primary school. Naturally, what I found to be most appealing (apart from the delights of a naked Kate Winslet) was the brilliant way in which this true human tragedy had been brought on screen  the grand sets, the accurate reproduction, the seamless special effects (in case you're wondering, I grew up to be an engineer). It left quite a mark on me  I confess to have seen hundreds of documentaries on how and why 'The Unsinkable Ship' dropped to the bottom of the ocean on its maiden voyage, so much so that I had become a self-professed guru on any and every Titanic factoid

Many repeat viewings later, I've developed a slightly different perspective towards this piece of cinema that still never ceases to amaze me. I'm in my twenties now, and have had my fair share of experiences  crush, heartbreak, love, et al (all the necessary experiences that are a pre-requisite for one to truly appreciate the world's favourite 'chick-flick'). I've realized that with time, my favourite portions from the movie have changed. Whereas earlier, I would happily skip the first half but never fail to catch the second, now I find myself to be fonder of the first hour, and even fonder of the last half. A part of the reason would be the advancement in digital effects since that time, which have given me the ability to grudgingly spot sections where the seamless computer effects don't seem to be so, well, seamless any more.

The main reason, however, is that I've developed something akin to an emotional bond with this film. Its brilliance lies in the way it manages to tell the story of a very personal tragedy while always focusing on, and never diluting, the epic tragedy that was the Titanic. And the moment where it never fails to touch a chord (relax, it's not the moment of Jack's death  I'm not even that clichéd) is when the now rather old and spotty Rose tells her listeners, 'I don't even have a picture of him; he exists now, only in my memory' A simple, yet beautiful and poignant moment, one that we can all relate with, especially for those among us who particularly cherish their memories, whatever they be. Memories always leave a mark (and sometimes they leave behind scars), such that, ever so often, a single instance can stay with us for an entire lifetime. Memories shape us, mould us, and are an integral part in the development and continued growth of what is known as an emotionally intelligent being. They truly are the human part within us animals.

Titanic then, is really quite a reflection of the true power of Human Memory."
2008-04-22,Aldri7,"So much has been said about ""Titanic"" , pro and con, I doubt I can add much to the discussion. I am one of those that has seen it numerous times (at least a dozen) and watching it now is a lot like putting on a comfortable old shoe. The nostalgic quality of the film was always a big draw for me anyway, and now, seeing it again brings on a sort of ""double nostalgia"" i.e. a nostalgia both for the movie itself as well as for the time period in which it took place.

We all know who Rose was or rather who she represented. She was the ""Miss Liberty"" that appeared on all the coins of the era, and whom also was the inspiration or model for the Statue of Liberty. At the moment she proclaimed her freedom in the movie, in fact, she traded her tight corsets for the same free flowing gown worn by those early feminist icons. I think a lot of people missed that point and instead took to making negative comments about her weight, etc as though an actress with a super model bod would have done a better job of projecting that Miss Liberty persona. Anyway, the more I see the movie now, the more I love both the old Rose and the Kate Winslet Rose. Young Rose wasn't an overly strong person through much of the movie, but that to me was consistent with the types of relationships she was in. I can see some wanting a sexier Rose, while others, a stronger and more assertive one. But to me, the balance was just about right as it had to be for the movie to succeed.

Otherwise, there are many other things I still marvel at while replaying this movie over and over again. For example, nine times out of ten, long movies suffer from problems related to pacing and holding the audiences attention. But Titanic's ""take it slow"" approach was in my mind a stroke of genius, not a fault, and the pacing was magnificent in the first half (pre iceberg). Paradoxically for me, the second half of the movie actually contained some of the ""slowest"" scenes, with ""slow"" being a relative term tied to one's expectations.

And then there is DiCaprio's Jack, and my only lingering regret with regards to this movie. Maybe I was wanting Matt Damon for the role. I don't know. But Jack's mix of humble roots and Paris sophistication was just too hard for me to swallow. It reminded me of how super sophisticate Hawkeye Pierce of ""M*A*S*H"" was actually from.......Crabapple Cove, Maine? This is Hollywood wanting to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. Jack did have to be an artist, though, because that was central to the plot. But his humble roots was to me just a case of ""balancing the ticket"" politically, so to speak, and was irrelevant otherwise.

Anyway, Titanic is still a beautiful and moving film to me. Sure, I might have toned down the cheesy aspects of the romance and cast a more mature and believable Jack, but the real achievement here lies elsewhere. People use terms like ""timeless"" and ""enduring"" when describing movies such as this, and yes they are clichés. But when applied to a historically based film they have real meaning. Implicit is the requirement that such a film span generations and appeal to filmgoers from across the decades. Titanic accomplished this beautifully in a unique and powerful way. As serious historical epics go, I suppose this movie will never be a heavyweight. But yet it still has that power to endure in one's psyche - almost as much as the original disaster may have endured in the memories of those that experienced it first hand."

2008-03-22,blondey089,"I've seen this movie numerous times, and it never ceases to amaze me that each time the movie ends, I am still stunned and touched with the pure beauty of this film. The film surely stand the test of time, and is proved that even 11 years after it release it still has the ability to astonish each viewer that has the privilege to watch it. It has the capability to stir every emotion inside. It contains all of the elements that make a beautiful movie. Its created with its amazing cast and superb acting.

Its also a showcase for Winslet and DiCaprio, two actors who have much become the greatest actors of our generation, and James Cameron's incredible and stunning directorial abilities.

What few flaws it has are nearly unnoticeable in this film that is beyond beautiful. Almost everyone has seen this movie, but if you are one of the few on earth who haven't, go out now and get it and you surely will be moved."

2008-03-02,canuckteach,"For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to ""My Heart Will Go On"" (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.

For one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in 'steerage' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There's the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the 'new world' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.

The sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).

This film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping 'Citizen Kane', 'Amadeus' or Sir David Lean's entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the 'mix' and 'editing', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay 'missed' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.

Having said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven't seen that before, very unique and effective.

2008-02-23,laucon,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. But what I sometimes get annoyed at (and Man in the Iron Mask had the exact same problem) is that everyone is oohing and awwing at Leo's hotness when they don't realize the philosophy behind it. The real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow, there would be no point in living. We just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold. So basically, caution is life's curse. Another philosophical message of this movie which is also political is that we have no control over the lives we're born into. We just have to make the best of them. I love this movie and I wish others would appreciate it the same way that I do."
2008-02-16,curtisloew,"It seems to me that 11 Oscars for this film is appalling. For some reason the nomination board have agreed that Titanic is one of the most revolutionary films ever made...

Little seems to be asked of when watching this film, never really challenging the viewer, and ensuring that there is a distance kept between the film and the audience at all times. Whilst there are strong acting performances in it, Titanic seems to drag on with a short period of concentrated action and meaning.

Could this be the most overrated film in history? It certainly seems that although winning 11 Oscars (only second my Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) Titanic doesn't appear to earn more than about 3 of these, with a vast amount of money poured into a film that nominators seem obliged to award Oscars to. For me, however, what seems to be the most disappointing thing is the apparent agreement of the IMDb public, not seconding the Oscar polls, with the film not even entering the top 250..."

2008-01-13,caradelizia_titanic,"This movie contains every single emotion of a human being. The heart-wrenching sadness of loosing your love ones is clearly shown in this movie.The music is the best part of the movie.Jack and Rose shine up as perfect lovers.The wreck of titanic is shown in this movie.The song ""my heart will go on"" is most favorite song of me.Every single person has worked hard yo make it a success.This was a very challenging for everyone when the ship broke and sank.I love this movie very much.Leonardo and Kate played the role of Jack and Rose and became perfect couple.According to me it is the best movie Ihave seen in my entire life and it can also be called ""the best film of all the centuries""."
2008-01-12,Stampsfightclub,"Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind) stars as Rose, a young rich lady who travels on the Titanic, the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912. The story is told from an older Rose's point of view as she experiences life on the ""unsinkable ship"". Meeting Jack Dawson (Leo Di Caprio  Gangs of New York) this charming romantic tale brings out a heart-warming story of young love with an unmissable ending.

Winner of 11 Oscars, David Cameron's Titanic is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another. Winslet and Di Caprio are perfect as the two characters. From the wealthy and stubborn Rose to the relaxed and positive Jack, audiences can appreciate each character's different backgrounds and engage more into their lives. The characters are well developed in this film, giving the film more depth. Di Caprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light hearted.

Many critics have argued its predictability and its clichés but with a film like this, you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselves.

The ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch, I was close to tears. However it is a must watch as the film delivers twist after twist in a powerful climax.

It's a very good film and one of the best love stories of all time"
2008-01-07,eimear114,"Don't get me wrong, I love the titanic but the historical inaccuracies really annoy me. like the fact that when the ship went under you could see the word Liverpool written on it but it merely sailed from Liverpool, it was created and built in Belfast. also for a ship created in northern Ireland there was English, Scottish, Irish and even welsh accents in it but not one northern Ireland accent which is strongly different from the rest, which fails to show the true origins of the film and i have to say i feel cheated!! (i am from NI) that being said i don't think that Cameron's aim was to show the history but to in fact show the emotion of the event which he does very successfully. definitely worth the tears i shed every time i watch it!!"

2008-01-05,RichardKleiner,"This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichéd and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know. James Horner's score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.

One critic spotted several technical errors in the movie, one of them being the sun's position during the ""I'm flying!"" sequence at the wrong side. But hey! If you want to find the bad stuff, you'll find it. That's not what film-making is about. You don't go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see (we got MST3K for that). Titanic is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day. I can only compare it to Casablanca, or more specially to Gone With the Wind. It's larger than life, it's long as hell, but it's enjoyable every single time you see it (I forgot how many times I've seen it on TV alone)."

2008-01-03,srkmish,"It really physically hurts me when i don't see it in top 250 in IMDb's list.I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films.We consider our films to be more emotional and poignant.

However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screen.I could see people's faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema hall.I could hear my father saying "" Never knew that these people could make such heart warming movies"".Maybe i am going a bit too far.But this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made."
2007-12-27,das_r,"I've seen this movie plenty of times about the time it was released. Well, a few years later, about 1999, but it's not so important. The point is, I was about 10 or 11 years at this time. But now, in the German Christmas TV programme, I saw this movie again. Only partly, but I was amazed of it. I became aware of things I didn't became aware of in this young age. As there were: 01) It might sound a bit bathetic, but ""Titanic"" is a really romantic film, it's kind of a Love Manifesto. There are two people who really love each other, with all consequences. This is really great, to see this true and honest love between two people which you don't see too often in real life, even though this is just a movie.

02) When you look a bit behind this romantic facade, ""Titanic"" is also a deeply social critical movie. On the one side, it shows those affectedly luxury and all those needless problems of the Rich, as well as the belief that with enough money you can buy anything (""We had an arrangement, Mr Murdoch!""). On the other side you see the misery of the Third Class people, you see how they are trapped in the sinking ship like animals, and you see how the Rich are treated much better only because they have money. But on the other hand, there is Rose, who only cares about Jack Dawson's personality and not about his financial situation.

03) The last thing I love at this movie is quite simple: It is a great document of one of the sadest stories in younger human history. It shows it all in detail, the arrogance of the White Star Line people, the desperation of the passengers as the ship is sinking, the fight for their life, the desperate try to find other ships to help, all showed really realistic and also strictly written after the reports of survivors. I think those whole Titanic thing is very interesting, and so I like the movie for showing the happenings of this evening very realistic and fascinating."
2007-12-17,soroush_amanolahi,"One of The Best Movies At All The Times there are great scents at this movie and really this is more than a movie.

it has an excellent score and song.they are so deep.

also titanic has won 11 Oscars in 1998 Leo and Kate played very good at this movie.

also Kate Winslet is very beautiful actress.

the start and end of this film was very good.

the scent of jack's death was so deep.

in my idea 14 Oscars nominations and 11 wining was worthy for titanic.

absolutely it was the best movie of James Cameroons."
2007-12-11,ruebels,"Let me preface this by saying I don't like ""chick flicks"". While Titanic does fall into this category, it also transcends it. It is a smartly crafted (having the present day scientist explain exactly what happens to the ship, so we as audience members are not confused later), well acted, and expertly edited masterpiece. There is no need for me to go into the story, as we all know it by now. I truly believe that the ones that hate this movie are self indulgent, wanna-be rebels who would hate anything if it didn't fit into their version of what ""real"" art should be (ie. cheap, not made for the masses). These people are as closed minded as racist KKK members."
2007-12-11,Mizz-Helena,"I've have seen Titanic many times, and it is one of my favorite movies. Every time it is still so sad, because of all the people who died there. Amazingly directed by James Cameron, who must be the greatest director out there next to Peter Jackson.

Now it is 10th anniversary since it has been released in 1998 in February. But it still looks like it has been made like yesterday to me, because of the amazing directing and the picture. I don't think anyone could make a great performance than Leonardo and Kate. They were the best couple ever.

The real story didn't include Rose and Jack, but it was great idea to make a great story before the sinking, and it was the sadest love story also. When Rose just found the greatest love of her life, she loosed him when the ship was sinking. Think about the great time they could have if both of them survived Titanic. And it was weird when the old Rose didn't tell anyone about Jack after 80 years. I wonder who she went to when the survivors came to land in New York. We know she didn't went to her fiancé, Cal. Did she really went to her weird mum? Did she go back to her dad? thats a mystery.

i would love anyway to go to a Titanic museum. I find the sinking story very touching and sad. If only all those people could have survived, i wonder how it would be now."
2007-12-01,Longest_Lasting_Redshirt,"My favorite films of the late 1990s are defiantly saving private Ryan, the sixth sense, and this.Each shot is so well crafted by a master of cinema, James Cameron. I first saw this movie when I was about eleven. I watched it because I became fascinated with the titanic. That was almost four years ago. Since then I have grown from loving flashy and violent movies to more well crafted (even though sometimes still violent, like the original Star Wars of Lord of the Rings) movies. Each shot is well done. I like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened. They had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes. All the actors were brilliant. I was surprised when I heard Kate Winslet in her British accent. The music was flawless. Some of the writing is a little cheesy, but it is redeemed by the rest of the movie, the brilliant directing, the factual accuracy, set design, and acting. Overall a brilliant film. 10/10"
2007-11-23,tennis_ace102,"This movie is brilliant i only understood this movie when i was 9 but from then on it has remained one of my favourites.

Great acting threw the whole movie. Leornado and Kate were brilliant as Jack and Rose.

The love story of jack and rose is simply beautiful It was a dream love story that you could only wish for until the Titanic hit the ice berg and then while the chaos was going on there love for each other shined threw Any guy who cares for a girl so much that he helps her to surive yet puts himself at risk of death is beautiful What made this movie special is the love story The Love story made the movie not so predictable because you didn't expect there to be this different side of it we all know what happened to the ship but we didn't know about this romance whether it was non fictional or fictional by the end i was in tears because of how sad it was but also because of how beautiful it was from the plot to the acting to the writing the movie was just Beautiful."

2007-11-06,Ibuk,"I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.

Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90's disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself"
2007-11-05,catalan5615,"The Titanic is one of my favorite movies because it was based on a true story. This movie has a lot of drama, action, and suspense. I like the setting of this movie because it takes place in the early 1900's and the replica of the ship is very semilar to the one that really sank in the Atlantic ocean. This is a very sad movie, and it also breaks your heart how all those people die trying to save their lives. Jack and Rose are the main character; they fall in love when they meet in the ship and they go through a lot of problems to stay together, but at the end it is very sad to see him die and not be able to be with his loved one. My vote for this movie is a 9 because it is a very good movie. I believe that the producers and directors did a very excellent job with this movie."

2007-10-30,ph133710101,"Titanic is an awful movie. Why? Many reasons. Kate Winslet is a good actress, however Leo and the rest of the cast is just pathetic. Second, this tries and fails to be a period piece. Its not, there are too many inaccuracies to even begin to go into, this is a Hollywood piece, not a period movie.

If you are an ignorant white suburban female, you'll cream your pants for this movie because you are n ignorant white suburban female. The ability of this movie to have that reaction makes it a stupid, terrible film, not a good film. Titanic is a really awful movie. I wish James Cameron and Kirk Cameron would get married."

2007-10-24,maazahmedsiddiqui-2,"Titanic was a movie that cannot be forgotten for ages. Titanic is the best movie I have ever seen. Titanic was perfect! It had everything. Drama, love, humor, adventure, action. You cant say what really happened on THE REAL TITANIC because you were not on it yourself. James Cameron (cool director) just a gave us an idea of how it must have felt to be on the real ship. He did a great job in using a love story to make people understand the tragedy of the real Titanic. JAMES CAMERON did a great job in showing us what it must have been to be in a sinking Titanic. I really loved it and I REALLY, REALLY recommend this movie to all of you!!!"
2007-10-17,crukeg,"Titanic is one of the best films of all time for many reasons. There is not one single problem with the picture. Not one. The effects are extraordinary, it's well acted, well written, convincing and spellbinding.

Two lovers from opposite worlds fall in love aboard the doomed ship titanic. And then the ship meets her doom. Their relationship is strengthened by their struggle to survive. This makes the film an experience instead of just entertainment.

Titanic has been bashed by many people for years. All I can say is that i think it is the second best film ever (behind shawshank), and that i don't care what they think.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate winslet are stunning and they give the film a basic story structure. Now these people can act.

James Cameron cleverly shows the peril that the passengers are in. We can relate to them, and we fear for them. It is horrifying to see them die. It is an intense and visceral experience.

This is a beautiful masterpiece about the tragic sinking of a great ship. super."
2007-10-14,bob the moo,"Rose DeWitt Bukater is a beautiful young woman, travelling to America to be married to the dashing cad that is Caledon Hockley. Jack Dawson is a poor Irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty  until, that is, he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes. Jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people. Meanwhile, on the upper decks, the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet Rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects. A chance meeting between Jack and Rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concerns.

As others have mentioned, Titanic seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse. When it came out it was the biggest movie of the day, sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the Best Picture Academy Award for that year. However as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had. To some this is just a simple backlash without basis but I'm not sure I agreed with that. Of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the ""success"" of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off James ""king of the world"" Cameron's face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day, without the crowded cinema, without the hype, without the partner to hug up to while watching.

So it is with me here. The first time I watched it I was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points. However watching it again I viewed it like I would any other film. As such the failings came tumbling out. The story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central ""relationship"" or the roundly average dialogue within the script. Funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a Bolton nightclub, the view would not be the same! Part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film, with James Horner's manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us ""you're meant to cry at this bit"". This is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your head.

Of course this is not so different from many Hollywood blockbuster, but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking. Director Cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer Cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in. When it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but I do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary, because there is little else for the viewer to feast on. Certainly the performances offer very little, mostly due to the material handed to them. DiCaprio is miscast. I know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and, as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect. Both he and Winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple. Zane hams it up as a ""baddie"" and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his co-stars. Bates, Fisher, Paxton, Warner, Amis, Hyde and others all fill round the edges with so-so performances.

There is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come. However the effects are already dating and, them to one side, there isn't a huge amount else to spend three hours on. The love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing. A big film but not really a good one."
